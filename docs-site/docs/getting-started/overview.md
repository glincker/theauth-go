# Overview

theauth-go is a production-ready Go auth library that covers the full authentication and authorization stack behind a single `go get`.

## Feature surface

### Identity and session management

- Opaque session tokens with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` cookies. Only a SHA-256 hash is persisted; the raw token never touches the database.
- Magic-link sign-in.
- Email and password with Argon2id (OWASP 2026 defaults), 12-character minimum enforcement, anti-enumeration safeguards.
- Per-IP and per-email rate limiting on every credential endpoint.
- WebAuthn / passkeys: discoverable login, sign-count replay protection, single-factor-strong per NIST SP 800-63B.
- TOTP second factor with 10 single-use recovery codes and a `pending_2fa` session step-up state machine.
- OAuth providers: GitHub, Google, Microsoft, Discord (PKCE-aware, AES-256-GCM at-rest token encryption).

### OAuth 2.1 authorization server

- `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414), `/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/revoke`, `/oauth/introspect`, `/oauth/jwks`.
- RFC 9068 JWT access tokens signed with Ed25519 (30-day JWKS rotation).
- RFC 8707 mandatory audience binding.
- PKCE S256 mandatory.
- RFC 9700 refresh-token rotation with family revocation on replay.
- RFC 7591 dynamic client registration with bearer-gated initial access tokens.

### MCP authorization

- First-class agent identities (user-owned or org-owned) with audited lifecycle (active, suspended, revoked).
- `client_credentials` grant for agent self-tokens.
- RFC 8693 token-exchange grant: scope narrowing, duration tightening, actor chain capped at 3.
- RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`.
- `mcpresource` SDK: a zero-dependency Go module for MCP resource servers. Wire one middleware for JWT validation, audience enforcement, actor-chain walking, and revocation propagation.

### Enterprise

- SAML 2.0 Service Provider (per-organization IdP binding, signed assertions only, find-or-create).
- SCIM 2.0 provisioning: Users and Groups CRUD, RFC 7644 PATCH, sha256 bearer tokens, per-org isolation.
- Organizations multi-tenancy with `active_organization_id` session scope.
- RBAC with a closed permission catalog, seeded roles, and `RequirePermission` middleware.

### Hardening and observability

- Append-only async audit log with default redactor and keyset pagination.
- Admin HTTP API at `/admin/v1` with RFC 7807 problem+json errors.
- Fuzz tests, race-clean test suite, benchmark gate.
- Pluggable `Storage` interface: in-memory (zero deps) or Postgres (`pgx/v5` + `sqlc`).
- Pluggable `Tracer` and `Metrics` adapters (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, or any custom backend).

```

Sessions are opaque tokens. The raw token lives only in the user's cookie; only a SHA-256 hash is persisted. Revocation is a single `UPDATE`. The `Storage` interface is the only surface a custom backend needs to implement.

The `mcpresource` module is a separately versioned zero-dependency module. A consumer importing it does not transitively pull theauth core or any storage adapter.
