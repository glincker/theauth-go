# Storage Backends

theauth-go ships three built-in storage adapters. All three implement the same `Storage` interface, so you can switch between them by changing a single constructor argument.

## In-memory (`storage/memory`)

```go
import "github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storage/memory"

store := memory.New()
```

- **Zero external dependencies.** No database process needed.
- **Not persistent.** All data is lost when the process restarts.
- **Use for:** local development, integration tests, quick demos.

## Postgres (`storage/postgres`)

```go
import (
    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"
    "github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storage/postgres"
)

pool, err := pgxpool.New(ctx, os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL"))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
store := postgres.New(pool)
```

- **Production-ready.** Persistent, concurrent, supports all theauth features.
- **Dependencies:** `pgx/v5`. Generated SQL from `sqlc`.
- **Migrations:** Embedded under `storage/postgres/migrations/`. They are append-only: columns and tables are added, never renamed destructively.

### Running migrations

The store does not auto-migrate. Run migrations yourself at startup or via a CI step, using the package-level `Migrate` function (not a method on `Store`):

```go
// postgres.Migrate applies every embedded migration under an advisory lock,
// so it is safe to call from every replica on boot.
if err := postgres.Migrate(ctx, pool); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
store := postgres.New(pool)
```

Or apply the SQL files directly:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f storage/postgres/migrations/0001_users.up.sql
# ... repeat for each migration in order
```

## The `Storage` interface

Both adapters satisfy `theauth.Storage`. The interface is the only surface a custom backend needs to implement. See [Storage Interface Reference](../reference/storage.md) for the full contract.

## Special rules

- Adding a method to `Storage` is a breaking change. New persistence operations land behind optional interfaces (e.g., `OAuthServerStorage`) detected at runtime via type assertion.
- The Postgres adapter's migrations directory is append-only. A renamed column ships as a new migration that adds the new column and removes the old one in a later release. This protects rolling-restart deployments.

## MySQL 8.x (`storage/mysql`) (v2.4)

```go
import (
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
    "github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storage/mysql"
)

db, err := sql.Open("mysql", os.Getenv("MYSQL_DSN"))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
store := mysql.New(db)
```

- **Full parity with the postgres adapter.** Satisfies both `theauth.Storage` and
  `OAuthServerStorage`. All dialect differences (e.g., `UUID()` instead of
  `gen_random_uuid()`, `GET_LOCK` instead of advisory locks) are handled
  internally.
- **Dependencies:** `go-sql-driver/mysql` v1.x. Generated SQL from `sqlc` targeting
  MySQL 8.x dialect.
- **Use for:** deployments on PlanetScale, AWS RDS MySQL, or any MySQL 8.x host.

### Running migrations

Like the Postgres adapter, `storage/mysql` embeds its migrations and exposes a
package-level `Migrate` function that applies them under a `GET_LOCK` advisory
lock:

```go
if err := mysql.Migrate(ctx, db); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
store := mysql.New(db)
```

Or apply the SQL files under `storage/mysql/migrations/` directly:

```bash
mysql -u root "$MYSQL_DATABASE" < storage/mysql/migrations/0001_init.up.sql
# ... repeat for each migration in order
```

### Contract testing

The `storagetest` suite can verify your MySQL instance satisfies the full
theauth-go contract. To run the contract tests against a live MySQL server, set
the environment variable before running tests:

```bash
THEAUTH_MYSQL_CONTRACT=1 \
  MYSQL_DSN="root:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/theauth_test?parseTime=true" \
  go test ./storage/mysql/...
```

Without `THEAUTH_MYSQL_CONTRACT=1`, the tests are skipped, so the suite is safe
to include in a standard `go test ./...` run that does not have a MySQL instance
available.

### Current parity caveats

- Advisory lock serialization (`GET_LOCK`) is weaker than Postgres serializable
  transactions. Avoid running concurrent schema migrations.
- MySQL does not support partial unique indexes. The `state='current'` JWKS
  constraint is enforced by application logic rather than a database constraint;
  the `clientauthcache` path is safe, but do not run multiple instances writing
  JWKS keys simultaneously without external coordination.

## Choosing a backend

| Situation | Backend |
|---|---|
| Local dev, CI | `memory` |
| Production (single node or replicated Postgres) | `postgres` |
| Production (MySQL 8.x, PlanetScale, RDS MySQL) | `mysql` |
| Custom database (SQLite, CockroachDB, etc.) | Implement `Storage`; see [Write a Custom Storage Backend](../guides/custom-storage-backend.md) |
