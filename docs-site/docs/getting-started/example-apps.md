# Example Apps

The repository ships runnable example applications covering every framework integration, OAuth provider, and observability backend. Each example has a `README`, single-file `main.go`, `go.mod`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, and `Makefile`.

## Running an example

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glincker/theauth-go
cd theauth-go/examples/chi-app
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d  # starts Postgres
make run
```

The chi-app listens on `:8080` by default. Check its `README` for the environment variables it reads.

## MCP server example

The `examples/mcp-server` example is the shortest demonstration of the `mcpresource` middleware on a chi server. It shows the one-import claim: middleware wiring plus principal extraction in roughly ten lines of Go. See [Resource Server (mcpresource)](../concepts/resource-server.md) for the walkthrough.
