# HTTP security

## Stdlib entry point

`(*TheAuth).Handler()` returns an `http.Handler` with every route `Mount`
registers, for `net/http` without chi:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.Handle("/auth/", a.Handler())
// or under a prefix: mux.Handle("/api/", http.StripPrefix("/api", a.Handler()))
```

## CSRF and Origin checks

`SameSite=Lax` does not stop requests from sibling subdomains, which are
same-site. theauth-go therefore rejects (403) any POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE
that carries cookies when its `Origin` (or, if absent, `Referer`) is not
trusted. Trusted means the `BaseURL` origin or an entry in
`Config.TrustedOrigins`. If neither header is present, a `Sec-Fetch-Site` of
`same-site` or `cross-site` is rejected.

Exempt: GET/HEAD/OPTIONS, requests with `Authorization: Bearer`, and requests
with no cookies. Set `Config.DisableCSRFProtection` to opt out.

## Secure cookies

Cookies get `Secure` when `Config.SecureCookie` is true, `BaseURL` is https,
the connection is TLS, or the peer is in `TrustedProxies` and sent
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. A plain-http `BaseURL` (local dev) stays non-Secure.

## Behind a reverse proxy

`X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` are honored only from peers inside
`Config.TrustedProxies`. The default is empty, so behind Caddy, nginx or a load
balancer every client appears as the proxy IP and the per-IP rate limit
collapses into one shared bucket. List the proxy network:

```go
TrustedProxies: []netip.Prefix{netip.MustParsePrefix("10.0.0.0/8")},
```

A startup warning is logged when the list is empty; set
`SuppressTrustedProxiesWarning` if the server is exposed directly.
