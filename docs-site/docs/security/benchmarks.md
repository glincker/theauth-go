# Benchmarks

theauth-go ships a benchmark gate that runs on every pull request and fails if any curated benchmark regresses more than 25% (the default threshold).

## Curated benchmarks

| Benchmark | Package | What it guards |
|---|---|---|
| `BenchmarkOAuthTokenEndpointRefreshHit` | `internal/bench` | `/oauth/token` refresh grant with Argon2 cache warm. The original 1254x regression source from the v2.0 audit. |
| `BenchmarkOAuthCodeFlow` | `internal/bench` | End-to-end authorization code grant: PKCE S256 verify + code consume + JWT mint + refresh insert. |
| `BenchmarkSCIMTokenAuth` | `internal/bench` | SCIM bearer auth: sha256 hash + one storage lookup. Guards the single-round-trip perf fix. |
| `BenchmarkRateLimitReadHeavy` | root package | Rate limiter under parallel read-heavy load. Guards the shared-RLock optimization. |
| `BenchmarkJWKSEndpoint` | `internal/bench` | JWKS endpoint: snapshot read + JSON marshal. Smoke-tests the signing-key cache. |
| `BenchmarkAuditRedactor` | `internal/bench` | Audit redactor EqualFold key matching. Guards the no-alloc-per-key optimization. |
| `BenchmarkArgon2Hash` | `crypto` | Argon2id hash at production work factor. |
| `BenchmarkArgon2Verify` | `crypto` | Argon2id verify at production work factor. |
| `BenchmarkJWTSign` | `internal/jwt` | Ed25519 JWT sign. |
| `BenchmarkJWTVerify` | `internal/jwt` | Ed25519 JWT verify. |
| `BenchmarkSessionLookup` | `internal/bench` | Cookie parse + token hash + map lookup. Floor cost per authenticated request. |
| `BenchmarkOAuthCallback` | `internal/bench` | AES-GCM encrypt + in-memory upsert. Covers the social-provider callback path. |

The authoritative list lives in `benchgate/curated.txt`. Edit that file to add or remove benchmarks; the gate script picks it up automatically.

## Running locally

```bash
# Full gate run (matches CI: 2 s per benchmark, 10 runs each):
./scripts/bench-gate.sh

# Quick smoke run (1 iteration only):
BENCH_TIME=1x BENCH_COUNT=1 ./scripts/bench-gate.sh

# Compare a feature branch against main:
git checkout main
./scripts/bench-gate.sh > /tmp/base.txt
git checkout my-feature
./scripts/bench-gate.sh > /tmp/pr.txt
benchstat /tmp/base.txt /tmp/pr.txt

# Check whether a diff file would pass the gate:
./scripts/bench-gate.sh --check /tmp/diff.txt
```

## Threshold

The default regression threshold is 25%. To change it:

- Globally for CI: update `THRESHOLD_PCT` in `.github/workflows/bench.yml`.
- For a single local run: `THRESHOLD_PCT=10 ./scripts/bench-gate.sh --check diff.txt`.

## CI workflow

The `bench` workflow (`.github/workflows/bench.yml`) runs on every pull request and on pushes to `main`.

Key design decisions:

- **Base caching:** the base-branch benchmark output is cached by commit SHA so re-runs of the same PR do not re-benchmark the base.
- **Cold-base fallback:** when no cache exists the workflow checks out the base commit, runs the benchmarks, saves the cache, then returns to the PR SHA.
- **PR comment:** on pull requests the diff is posted as a PR comment so reviewers see the delta without downloading artifacts.
- **Artifacts:** `pr-bench.txt`, `base-bench.txt`, and `diff.txt` are uploaded as workflow artifacts (retained 90 days).

## Adding a benchmark

1. Write the benchmark in the appropriate package following existing conventions (see `internal/bench/` for examples).
2. Add the benchmark name to `benchgate/curated.txt` with a comment explaining what regression it catches.
3. Run `BENCH_TIME=1x BENCH_COUNT=1 ./scripts/bench-gate.sh` locally to confirm it appears and exits 0.

## Noisy benchmark skip annotation

If a benchmark routinely produces more than 10% noise, add a `# gate:skip` line in `benchgate/curated.txt`:

```
# gate:skip BenchmarkFoo -- high variance on shared runners; tracked in issue #NNN
```

Do not skip a benchmark without a reference to a tracking issue.
