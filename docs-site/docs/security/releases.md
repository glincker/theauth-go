# Releases and Verification

Every theauth-go release artifact is signed with `cosign` keyless signing via Sigstore OIDC (GitHub Actions identity). The release workflow also generates a CycloneDX SBOM and a SLSA provenance attestation.

## Release process

See [RELEASING.md](https://github.com/glincker/theauth-go/blob/main/docs/RELEASING.md) in the repository for the full maintainer process. In brief:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`: move entries from `[Unreleased]` to a versioned section.
2. Open and merge a PR for the changelog.
3. Tag the release:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "theauth-go vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs goreleaser, cosign, and the SLSA attestation step.

## Verifying a release

### Download assets

```bash
gh release download vX.Y.Z --repo glincker/theauth-go --dir /tmp/release-check
```

### Verify the SBOM signature

```bash
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/glincker/theauth-go/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/vX.Y.Z" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --signature /tmp/release-check/theauth-go-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sbom.json.sig \
  --certificate /tmp/release-check/theauth-go-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sbom.json.cert \
  /tmp/release-check/theauth-go-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sbom.json
```

### Verify the source archive signature

```bash
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/glincker/theauth-go/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/vX.Y.Z" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --signature /tmp/release-check/theauth-go-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sig \
  --certificate /tmp/release-check/theauth-go-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.cert \
  /tmp/release-check/theauth-go-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
```

Both commands should print `Verified OK`.

### Verify SLSA provenance

```bash
gh attestation verify /tmp/release-check/theauth-go-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz \
  --repo glincker/theauth-go
```

## Pre-release tags

Tags with `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc` suffixes are published as pre-releases automatically (`prerelease: auto` in `.goreleaser.yml`). Follow the same tag procedure; GitHub marks the release as a pre-release.

## Rollback

If a bad release is published:

1. Delete the tag: `git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`
2. Delete the GitHub Release: `gh release delete vX.Y.Z --repo glincker/theauth-go`
3. Fix the issue, cut a patch release (vX.Y.Z+1), and re-tag.

Do not reuse a version number after publishing it. Consumers may have cached the module at that version in their module proxy.
