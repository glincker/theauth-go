# Storage Interface

The `theauth.Storage` interface is the single surface a custom backend must implement. Three built-in adapters are provided: `storage/memory`, `storage/postgres`, and (since v2.4) `storage/mysql`.

## Stability guarantee

The base `Storage` interface is frozen at v1.0. Adding a method to it is a v2.0 breaking change. New persistence operations land behind optional extension interfaces (e.g., `OAuthServerStorage`) that the library detects via type assertion at `theauth.New` time.

## In-tree adapters

| Package | Use case |
|---|---|
| `github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storage/memory` | Local dev, testing |
| `github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storage/postgres` | Production (`pgx/v5` + `sqlc`) |
| `github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storage/mysql` | Production, MySQL 8.x (v2.4+) |

All adapters expose `New(...)` constructors that return a `*Store` satisfying
`theauth.Storage`.

## Extension interface: `OAuthServerStorage`

When `Config.AuthorizationServer` is set, the storage adapter must also satisfy `OAuthServerStorage`. This interface adds methods for OAuth clients, authorization codes, refresh tokens, JWKS keys, agents, and delegation grants.

Both in-tree adapters satisfy `OAuthServerStorage` when the OAuth 2.1 AS migrations have been applied.

## Conformance suite (`storagetest`)

Since v2.4, theauth-go ships a public contract test suite in the `storagetest`
package. Any custom adapter (or a new in-tree adapter) can be verified by calling
`storagetest.Run`:

```go
import "github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storagetest"

func TestConformance(t *testing.T) {
    storagetest.Run(t, func() theauth.Storage {
        return mystorage.New()
    })
}
```

The suite covers 12 functional areas:

- Sessions (create, lookup, revoke)
- Password hashes (set, verify, re-hash)
- OAuth clients (CRUD, DCR)
- Authorization codes (issue, consume, replay prevention)
- Refresh tokens (issue, rotate, family revocation)
- JWKS keys (rotation, exactly-one-current constraint)
- Agents and agent credentials
- Delegation grants (grant, revoke, chain lookup)
- CIBA requests (create, approve, deny, poll, ping)
- Storagetest idempotency (re-running inserts is safe)
- Error sentinel conformance (`ErrStorageNotFound` on misses)
- Concurrent writes (race detector clean)

Both in-tree adapters (`postgres` and `mysql`) run this suite in CI. Run it
against your own adapter to verify parity.

To gate a live-database contract test behind an environment variable (so it
is skipped in offline CI):

```go
func TestConformance(t *testing.T) {
    if os.Getenv("MYDB_CONTRACT") == "" {
        t.Skip("set MYDB_CONTRACT=1 to run live storage contract tests")
    }
    db := openTestDB(t)
    storagetest.Run(t, func() theauth.Storage { return mystore.New(db) })
}
```

## Special rules

### Append-only migrations

The `storage/postgres/migrations/` directory is append-only. Columns are added via new migrations; they are never renamed destructively. This protects rolling-restart deployments.

### Audit table append-only

The `audit_events` table is append-only by contract. Adapters MUST NOT expose `UPDATE` or `DELETE` for audit rows. The `Storage` interface deliberately offers only `InsertAuditEvents` and `QueryAuditEvents`. Operators wanting tamper-evidence should layer Merkle signing on top.

### `ErrNotFound`

On lookup misses, adapters MUST return `theauth.ErrStorageNotFound` (re-exported from `storage.ErrNotFound`). The service layer uses `errors.Is` checks against this sentinel to distinguish "row missing" from other errors.

See [Write a Custom Storage Backend](../guides/custom-storage-backend.md) for the step-by-step guide, including how to run the conformance suite.
