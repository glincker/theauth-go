# API Tokens and Device Login

Scoped API tokens give scripts, CI jobs and CLIs a credential that is narrower than a user session. The device grant (RFC 8628) lets a CLI obtain one by having a signed-in user approve a short code in the browser.

## Enable

```go
a, err := theauth.New(theauth.Config{
    Storage: store, // must implement APITokenStorage (memory does)
    BaseURL: "https://app.example.com",
    APITokens: &theauth.APITokensConfig{
        Abilities: []string{"read", "write", "deploy"},
        UserAbilities: func(ctx context.Context, u *theauth.User) ([]string, error) {
            return abilitiesFor(u), nil // your role model
        },
        Device: &theauth.DeviceConfig{
            VerificationURI:  "https://app.example.com/device",
            DefaultAbilities: []string{"read"},
        },
    },
})
```

`Device` is optional and needs `DeviceCodeStorage` as well. New returns `ErrStorageMissingCapability` when the storage lacks a required capability.

## Model

- A token is `<prefix>_<43 random chars>`. The secret is returned once. Only its SHA-256 is stored, plus a short hint for display.
- Abilities are strings you define. `root` is reserved, implies every ability, and cannot be combined with others.
- Every token expires. The default lifetime is 90 days, capped by `MaxTTL` (365 days).
- The owner is a user or a service account. A service account is an ID with no user row, created by an admin minting a token with `service_account: true`.
- Abilities are checked fresh on every request: a token's effective abilities are its stored abilities intersected with what the owner currently holds. Demoting a user narrows their existing tokens at once.
- A token stops working when its owner row is deleted or `OwnerActive` reports false. Call `RevokeOwnerAPITokens` when you delete a user or retire a service account.

Abilities for session users come from `UserAbilities`. Without it an admin (`IsAdmin`, by default the system `super_admin` RBAC role) holds `root` and everyone else holds nothing.

## Protect routes

```go
r.With(a.RequireAbility("deploy")).Post("/deploy", handler)
```

`RequireAbility` accepts a full session cookie or `Authorization: Bearer`. A presented bearer token never falls back to the cookie. Handlers read the caller with `theauth.PrincipalFromContext`.

## HTTP routes

| Route | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /auth/tokens` | session | Mint `{name, abilities, expires_in}`. Cannot exceed the caller's abilities. Admins may add `service_account: true` and optional `owner_id`. |
| `GET /auth/tokens` | session | List your tokens. Admins: `?all=true` or `?owner_id=`. |
| `DELETE /auth/tokens/{id}` | session | Revoke your token. Admins may revoke any. Others get 404. |
| `GET /auth/tokens/current` | bearer | Describe the presented token: id, name, kind, agentName, abilities as currently effective after owner clamping, ownerId, ownerKind, createdAt, expiresAt, lastUsedAt. Never the secret or hash. Needs no ability. Session cookie gets 403. |
| `DELETE /auth/tokens/current` | bearer | Revoke the presented token (204), emit the token revoked audit event and the revocation bus event. The token is dead afterwards, so a repeat call gets 401. Needs no ability. Session cookie gets 403. |

Token management is session only, so a token cannot mint or revoke tokens.

## Device grant

1. The CLI calls `POST /auth/device/code` (`client_name`, `scope` as space separated abilities) and shows the `user_code` and `verification_uri`.
2. A signed-in user posts the code to `POST /auth/device/approve` with `action` of `info`, `approve` or `deny`, optionally narrowing `abilities`.
3. The CLI polls `POST /auth/device/token` with the device grant type until it gets `access_token`.

Behavior worth knowing:

- Polling faster than the interval returns `slow_down` and widens the interval by 5 seconds.
- Redeem is an atomic claim: of any number of concurrent polls, exactly one mints a token.
- The minted token expires (`DeviceConfig.TokenTTL`, default 30 days) and its abilities are the requested set capped to the approver's current abilities. `root` is granted only when requested and the approver holds it, otherwise approval fails with 403.
- Wrong user codes count against a per-approver and per-IP budget (5 per 15 minutes), after which approval returns 429.
- Show the requester IP and user agent from `action: info` on your approval page.

Go callers can skip HTTP: `StartDeviceAuth`, `LookupDeviceRequest`, `DecideDeviceRequest`, `RedeemDeviceCode`, `MintAPIToken`, `AuthenticateAPIToken`, `ListAPITokens`, `RevokeAPIToken`.

## Custom storage

Implement `APITokenStorage` and `DeviceCodeStorage` and run `storagetest.RunAPITokens` and `storagetest.RunDeviceCodes`. `ClaimDeviceCode` and `DecideDeviceCode` must be single compare-and-set statements. Do not add a foreign key from the token owner to users: service account owners have no user row.
