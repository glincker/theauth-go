# Policy Engine

The `policy` package adds fine-grained authorization on top of sessions and API
tokens. Policies are JSON documents of allow and deny statements. Evaluation is
default-deny, and an explicit deny always wins.

```go
import "github.com/glincker/theauth-go/v2/policy"
```

## Policy documents

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "statements": [
    {
      "id": "deploy-own-project",
      "effect": "allow",
      "actions": ["deploy:*", "project:read"],
      "resources": ["project/{project_id}", "project/{project_id}/*"],
      "conditions": [
        {"op": "ip_cidr", "key": "ip", "values": ["10.0.0.0/8"]},
        {"op": "daily_window", "values": ["06:00", "22:00"]}
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "prod-freeze",
      "effect": "deny",
      "actions": ["deploy:*"],
      "resources": ["project/*/env/prod"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Globs.** `*` matches any run of characters, including `/`. A backslash
  escapes the next character. Matching is case sensitive.
- **Variables.** `{name}` in a resource or condition value is replaced from the
  request attributes. Substituted values are escaped, so an attribute of `*`
  cannot widen a statement. If a variable is missing, an allow statement does
  not match and a deny statement still applies (fail closed).
- **Conditions.** All must hold. Operators: `equals`, `not_equals`, `in`,
  `not_in`, `ip_cidr`, `not_ip_cidr` (key `ip`), `time_window` (two RFC 3339
  bounds, either may be empty) and `daily_window` (`HH:MM` UTC, may wrap
  midnight). Positive operators are false for a missing key, negated ones are
  true, so a "deny unless from the office network" rule blocks unknown callers.
- **Parsing.** `policy.Parse` rejects unknown fields, unknown versions and
  oversize documents. Use `Policy.Marshal` to write the canonical form.

## Evaluating directly

```go
d := policy.Evaluator{}.Evaluate(policy.Request{
    Action:     "deploy:create",
    Resource:   "project/p1",
    Attributes: map[string]string{"project_id": "p1"},
    IP:         "10.1.2.3",
}, p)
// d.Allowed, d.PolicyID, d.StatementID, d.Reason
```

## HTTP middleware

```go
guard, _ := policy.New(policy.Options{
    Auth:  auth,   // *theauth.TheAuth, needs Config.APITokens
    Store: store,  // a policy.Storage
    Audit: auth,
    Subjects: func(ctx context.Context, p *theauth.Principal) ([]policy.Subject, error) {
        ids, err := myApp.GroupIDs(ctx, p.UserID) // read fresh each request
        ...
    },
})

r.With(guard.RequirePolicy("deploy:create", func(r *http.Request) policy.Resource {
    id := chi.URLParam(r, "project")
    return policy.Resource{Name: "project/" + id, Attributes: map[string]string{"project_id": id}}
})).Post("/projects/{project}/deploy", deploy)
```

`RequirePolicy` resolves the session, API token or agent token on every request,
loads the policies attached to the user, the groups and roles your `Subjects`
callback returns, and the token, then evaluates. A denial responds `403`:

```json
{"code": "policy.denied", "status": 403, "detail": "explicit deny",
 "decision": {"allowed": false, "effect": "deny", "policyId": "freeze", "statementId": "prod-freeze", "reason": "explicit deny"}}
```

Every decision emits a `policy.decision` audit event with the action, resource,
policy, statement and reason (set `AuditDenyOnly` to skip allows). Built-in
attributes: `principal.id`, `principal.kind`, `token.id`, `agent.name`. Add more
with `Options.Attributes`.

## Permission boundary for tokens

Policies attached to a token (`SubjectToken`) form a boundary. The request must
be allowed by the owner's policies and by the boundary, and a boundary deny
blocks it, so a token can only be narrower than its owner, never wider. An
agent token is evaluated as its delegating human plus its own boundary.

## Storage

`policy.Storage` (alias `PolicyStorage`) is an optional capability.
`policy.NewMemory()` is the reference implementation, and a backend proves
conformance with `storagetest.RunPolicy`. Suggested SQL schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE policies (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  document    TEXT NOT NULL,          -- JSONB on Postgres, JSON on MySQL
  created_at  TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_at  TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE policy_attachments (
  subject_kind TEXT NOT NULL,         -- user | group | role | token
  subject_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
  policy_id    TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES policies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY (subject_kind, subject_id, policy_id)
);
CREATE INDEX policy_attachments_subject ON policy_attachments (subject_kind, subject_id);
```

`PutPolicy` upserts and keeps `created_at`. `PoliciesFor` orders by policy ID,
then subject kind and ID.

## Worked example: a deploy platform

A project admin can do everything in their project, a developer cannot touch
production, and CI tokens may only deploy to staging.

```json
{"version":"1","id":"project-admin","statements":[
  {"id":"all-in-project","effect":"allow","actions":["*"],"resources":["project/{project_id}","project/{project_id}/*"]}]}
```

```json
{"version":"1","id":"developer","statements":[
  {"id":"dev-rw","effect":"allow","actions":["project:read","deploy:*","env:*"],"resources":["project/{project_id}/*"]},
  {"id":"no-prod","effect":"deny","actions":["deploy:*","env:write"],"resources":["project/*/env/prod"]}]}
```

```json
{"version":"1","id":"ci-staging","statements":[
  {"id":"staging-only","effect":"allow","actions":["deploy:create"],"resources":["project/*/env/staging"]}]}
```

Attach `project-admin` and `developer` to groups, and `ci-staging` to a CI
token. Even if the CI token's owner is a project admin, the token can only run
`deploy:create` on staging. Removing a user from a group takes effect on the
next request because group membership is resolved per request.
