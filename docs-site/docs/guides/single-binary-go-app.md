# Auth for a Single-Binary Go App

This guide builds the shape many self-hosted tools have: one static Go binary, one SQLite file, a web UI or API, and a CLI that signs in as the same users. Everything below is implemented by `examples/single-binary-sqlite`, which also has a smoke test that runs the whole flow.

You need Go 1.26 or newer. `storage/sqlite` pulls in `modernc.org/sqlite`, which declares Go 1.26. The root `theauth-go` module itself builds on Go 1.25.

```sh
go get github.com/glincker/theauth-go
go get github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storage/sqlite
```

## 1. Open SQLite and migrate

You own the `*sql.DB`. Foreign keys must be on, and WAL plus a busy timeout are advised:

```go
db, err := sql.Open("sqlite",
    "file:app.db?_pragma=foreign_keys(1)&_pragma=busy_timeout(5000)&_pragma=journal_mode(WAL)&_txlock=immediate")
if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }
if err := db.PingContext(ctx); err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }
if err := sqlitestore.Migrate(ctx, db); err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }
store, err := sqlitestore.New(db)
```

Import the driver with `_ "modernc.org/sqlite"`. No cgo is involved, so `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build` yields a static binary. Details are in [Use the SQLite Backend](sqlite-storage.md).

## 2. Configure theauth-go

```go
a, err := theauth.New(theauth.Config{
    CoreStorage:  store,
    BaseURL:      "https://app.example.com",
    Bootstrap:    &theauth.BootstrapConfig{SetupToken: os.Getenv("SETUP_TOKEN")},
    APITokens: &theauth.APITokensConfig{
        Abilities: []string{"read"},
        UserAbilities: func(context.Context, *theauth.User) ([]string, error) {
            return []string{"read"}, nil
        },
        Device: &theauth.DeviceConfig{
            VerificationURI:  "https://app.example.com/device",
            DefaultAbilities: []string{"read"},
        },
    },
})
```

- `CoreStorage` is used because SQLite does not implement organizations, SAML, SCIM or RBAC. Enabling a feature that needs one fails in `New` with `ErrStorageMissingCapability`. See [Capability interfaces](../concepts/capability-interfaces.md).
- `Bootstrap` closes public signup until the first user exists. Without `SetupToken`, a random one is generated and logged once. `a.SetupToken()` returns it if you would rather print it yourself.
- Without RBAC there is no admin role, so supply `UserAbilities` yourself. It is evaluated on every request, so changing a user's role narrows their existing tokens at once.
- Local HTTP only: leave `BaseURL` as `http://...` and the cookie is not marked `Secure`. With an `https://` base URL it is.

## 3. Mount on the stdlib mux

`a.Handler()` returns an `http.Handler` serving the canonical `/auth/...` paths, so no router dependency is needed:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.Handle("/auth/", a.Handler())
mux.Handle("GET /api/whoami", a.RequireAbility("read")(http.HandlerFunc(whoami)))

func whoami(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    p, _ := theauth.PrincipalFromContext(r.Context())
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]any{"userId": p.UserID.String(), "abilities": p.Abilities})
}
```

`RequireAbility` accepts either a session cookie or `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and returns 403 when the caller lacks the ability. A presented bearer token never falls back to the cookie.

## 4. First run

```sh
curl -c jar -X POST $BASE/auth/email-password/signup \
  -H "X-Setup-Token: $SETUP_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"a long passphrase here"}'
```

The token goes in the `X-Setup-Token` header or a `setupToken` body field. After the first user exists, further signups are refused with `signup_closed` unless `OpenSignupAfterFirstUser` is set. The first admin must use a password, because magic links cannot carry the token. `GET /auth/bootstrap/status` returns `{"needsSetup": true}` until then, which a UI can use to show a setup screen.

## 5. Mint a token

A signed-in user mints a scoped token with the built-in route. The secret is returned once:

```sh
curl -b jar -X POST $BASE/auth/tokens -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"ci","abilities":["read"],"expires_in":2592000}'
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $BASE/api/whoami
```

A token cannot exceed the abilities its owner holds now. See [API Tokens and Device Login](api-tokens.md) for revocation, listing, service accounts and agent tokens (`MintAgentToken`).

## 6. Sign a CLI in with the device grant

On the server, `Device` enables `/auth/device/code`, `/auth/device/token` and `/auth/device/approve`. You provide the page at `VerificationURI`: it must sign the user in and post the code to `/auth/device/approve`. The example ships a 60 line page for this.

In the CLI, `clientauth` needs only the standard library:

```go
store, _ := clientauth.NewFileStore("mycli")
cred, err := clientauth.DeviceLogin(ctx, clientauth.DeviceOptions{
    ServerURL: server, ClientName: "mycli", Store: store,
})
client, _ := clientauth.NewClient(server, store)
id, err := client.Whoami(ctx)   // GET /auth/tokens/current
err = client.Logout(ctx)        // revokes server side, then deletes the local copy
req, _ := client.NewRequest(ctx, http.MethodGet, "/api/whoami", nil)
resp, err := client.Do(req)     // attaches the bearer token, same origin only
```

`DeviceLogin` prints the code and URL, polls at the server's interval, and backs off on `slow_down`. See [CLI Login](cli-login.md).

## 7. Sensitive actions: step-up

Session storage in SQLite supports step-up. Guard dangerous routes so a stale session must re-authenticate:

```go
mux.Handle("POST /admin/purge", a.RequireRecentAuth(5*time.Minute)(http.HandlerFunc(purge)))
```

The client calls `POST /auth/step-up` with `{"method":"password","password":"..."}` (or TOTP) first. Passkeys (`Config.WebAuthn`) and TOTP (`Config.TOTP`, needs `EncryptionKey`) are available on SQLite too. See [Session management](https://github.com/glincker/theauth-go/blob/main/docs/SESSIONS.md).

## 8. Housekeeping

Expired rows are not deleted on read. Run `store.SweepExpired(ctx, time.Now())` on a ticker. Revocations (a token, a session, an owner) publish on `Config.RevocationBus`; the default bus is in-process, which is correct for a single binary. Use `a.WatchRevocationMiddleware` after `RequireAbility` on SSE or other long-lived handlers so they drop when the credential is revoked.

## Run the example

```sh
cd examples/single-binary-sqlite
go vet ./... && go test ./...
SETUP_TOKEN=change-me go run .
```

The test boots the server, creates the first admin, mints a token, runs `mycli login` headlessly and approves it, then calls the API with the device-issued token and logs out.
