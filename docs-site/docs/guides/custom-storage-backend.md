# Write a Custom Storage Backend

theauth-go's persistence layer is pluggable via the `Storage` interface. You can implement it for any database: MySQL, SQLite, DynamoDB, or any custom store.

## The `Storage` interface

The `Storage` interface is defined in the root package (`github.com/glincker/theauth-go`). It covers sessions, users, magic links, password reset tokens, WebAuthn credentials, TOTP secrets, OAuth accounts, and more.

Browse the interface in the [Storage Reference](../reference/storage.md) or on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/glincker/theauth-go#Storage).

## The `storagetest` package

The repository ships `github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storagetest`: a conformance test suite that verifies a storage implementation satisfies the full contract. Run it against your implementation before using it in production:

```go
package mystorage_test

import (
    "testing"

    "github.com/glincker/theauth-go/storagetest"
    "myapp/mystorage"
)

func TestConformance(t *testing.T) {
    storagetest.Run(t, func() theauth.Storage {
        return mystorage.New(/* your config */)
    })
}
```

All methods in the conformance suite are run with `t.Run` sub-tests so failures are reported per-method.

## Extension interfaces

If you also want to support the OAuth 2.1 AS, implement `OAuthServerStorage` in addition to `Storage`. The library detects it via type assertion at `theauth.New` time:

```go
type OAuthServerStorage interface {
    Storage
    // OAuth clients, authorization codes, refresh tokens,
    // JWKS keys, agents, delegation grants, etc.
}
```

The base `Storage` interface only grows in a major release. New persistence operations land behind optional extension interfaces so upgrading the library does not break existing custom implementations.

## Stability note

The `Storage` interface is covered by the v1.0 stability commitment (see [STABILITY.md](https://github.com/glincker/theauth-go/blob/main/STABILITY.md)). Adding a method to `Storage` requires a v2.0 release. New optional capabilities are added as separate interfaces.

## Migration append-only rule

If your custom storage uses SQL, follow the same append-only migration rule the Postgres adapter uses: never rename a column in-place; add the new column in one migration and remove the old one in a later release. This protects rolling-restart deployments.

## Tips

- Use the in-memory adapter as a reference implementation. It is well-commented and covers every interface method.
- Use `storage/postgres` for understanding the expected SQL semantics (keyset pagination, UPSERT patterns, etc.).
- The conformance suite tests edge cases like duplicate key errors, not-found errors, and pagination cursor behavior. Pass it before shipping.
