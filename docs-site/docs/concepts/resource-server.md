# Resource Server (mcpresource)

The `mcpresource` module is a zero-dependency Go module for MCP resource servers. It validates bearer JWTs, enforces audience claims, walks RFC 8693 actor chains via AS introspection, and emits the correct `WWW-Authenticate` response on failure.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/glincker/theauth-go/mcpresource
```

`mcpresource` has **no third-party dependencies**. Importing it does not pull in theauth core or any storage adapter.

## Wire the middleware

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/glincker/theauth-go/mcpresource"
    "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
)

func main() {
    v := mcpresource.New(
        "https://mcp.example.com",       // the resource URI this server serves
        mcpresource.WithJWKS("https://as.example.com/oauth/jwks"),
        mcpresource.WithIntrospection(
            "https://as.example.com/oauth/introspect",
            "mcp-client-id",
            "mcp-client-secret",
        ),
    )

    r := chi.NewRouter()
    r.Use(v.Middleware)

    r.Get("/tools/run", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        p, _ := v.Principal(r.Context())
        // p.Subject    -- the originating user (or root agent)
        // p.Actor      -- the innermost agent currently acting
        // p.ActorChain -- slice from innermost to outermost
    })

    http.ListenAndServe(":8090", r)
}
```

## What the middleware validates

On every request the middleware:

1. Extracts the bearer token from the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header.
2. Verifies the JWT signature against a cached JWKS (refreshes on `kid` miss and at the configured cache TTL).
3. Enforces the `aud` claim against the resource URI passed to `mcpresource.New`.
4. Checks `exp`, `nbf`, and `iat` with a 60-second clock skew tolerance (configurable).
5. Walks the RFC 8693 `act` chain via AS introspection and returns `active: false` if any delegation grant in the chain is revoked.
6. On any failure: emits HTTP 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token", resource_metadata="..."` per RFC 6750 and RFC 9728.

## The `Principal` type

```go
type Principal struct {
    Subject    string   // sub claim: user ULID or "agent:<id>"
    Actor      string   // innermost acting identity; equals Subject when no delegation chain
    ActorChain []string // from innermost to outermost
    Scope      []string // scope claim split on spaces
    ClientID   string   // OAuth client that obtained the token
    IssuedAt   time.Time
    ExpiresAt  time.Time
    // Issuer, Audience, JWTID, DelegationGrantID, and CnfJKT (DPoP jkt
    // thumbprint) are also populated; see mcpresource/principal.go.
}
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WithJWKS(url)` | required | JWKS endpoint URL for signature verification. |
| `WithIntrospection(url, clientID, secret)` | required | Introspection endpoint + client credentials. |
| `WithCacheTTL(d)` | 60s | How long JWKS keys and introspection responses are cached. |
| `WithHTTPClient(c)` | `http.DefaultClient` | Custom HTTP client (e.g., for timeouts or mTLS). |
| `WithClockSkew(d)` | 60s | Tolerance for `exp`/`nbf`/`iat` clock drift. |

## Concurrent safety

The JWKS and introspection caches use `sync.RWMutex` internally so concurrent reads do not serialize. Cache writes (on miss or TTL expiry) take a write lock for the minimum duration.

## Runnable example

See [`examples/mcp-server/`](https://github.com/glincker/theauth-go/tree/main/examples/mcp-server) for a complete standalone demo.
