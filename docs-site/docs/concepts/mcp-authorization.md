# MCP Authorization

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification (2025-11-25 and the draft revision) mandates OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for any MCP server that exposes tools over HTTP. The authorization layer is more involved than a typical app-login because the *caller* is an AI agent, not a human, and the chain of delegation must be auditable and revocable at every link.

## What the MCP spec requires

1. **An OAuth 2.1 AS** that mints RFC 9068 JWT access tokens bound to a specific resource via RFC 8707.
2. **Agent identities:** Long-lived client credentials for the agents a user trusts (`client_credentials` grant).
3. **Delegation grants:** A user-approved record that lets a specific agent act on a specific resource. Revoking the grant invalidates every derived token at the next introspection refresh.
4. **Token exchange (RFC 8693):** When an agent acts on behalf of a user, the access token carries an `act` claim chain so the resource server can see the full delegation path and reject the request if any link is revoked.
5. **Resource server validation:** The MCP tool server validates tokens, enforces audience binding, walks the actor chain, and emits the correct `WWW-Authenticate` header on failure (RFC 6750 + RFC 9728).
6. **Discovery documents:** `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414) and `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728) so MCP clients can auto-configure.

## How theauth-go covers the spec

```
User browser  ----[authorization code + PKCE]----> theauth AS
                                                    |
MCP client    ----[client_credentials]------------>  |  (agent self-token)
                                                    |
MCP client    ----[token-exchange]---------------->  |  (user delegates to agent)
                                                    |
MCP tool srv  <---[JWT with act chain]------------- |
      |
      v  (validates via mcpresource middleware)
      |-- JWKS verify
      |-- audience enforce
      |-- act chain walk via introspection
      |-- revocation propagate
```

Every step ships in theauth-go:

| MCP requirement | theauth-go component |
|---|---|
| OAuth 2.1 AS | `Config.AuthorizationServer` |
| Agent identities | `Config.AgentIdentity`, `CreateAgent`, `MintAgentCredential` |
| Delegation grants | `GrantDelegation`, `RevokeDelegation` |
| Token exchange | `/oauth/token` with `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` |
| Resource server middleware | `github.com/glincker/theauth-go/mcpresource` |
| Discovery documents | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` |

## The one-import claim

The `mcpresource` module is a separately versioned, zero-dependency Go module. A consumer importing it does not transitively pull theauth core or any storage adapter. This matters for MCP tool servers that are operated independently of the AS.

## Actor chain depth

The RFC 8693 `act` chain is capped at 3 links (configurable via `AgentConfig.MaxChainDepth`, hard ceiling 3). Deeper chains are rejected with `invalid_request: actor chain depth exceeded`. This prevents runaway delegation trees and limits blast radius if any agent is compromised.

## Revocation propagation

When a user revokes a delegation grant:

1. The `delegation_grants.revoked_at` field is set immediately.
2. New introspection calls return `active: false`.
3. The `mcpresource` validator refreshes its introspection cache within `CacheTTL` (default 60 seconds).
4. After the TTL, every request using a derived token returns 401.

There is no immediate token blacklist push; the propagation window is the cache TTL. Operators who need sub-second propagation should set `WithCacheTTL(0)` on the `mcpresource.Validator` and accept the per-request introspection cost.
