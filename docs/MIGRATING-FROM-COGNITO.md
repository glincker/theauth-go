# Migrating from AWS Cognito to theauth-go

This playbook walks through moving a Cognito user pool to theauth-go. The process
is two stages: export (convert the Cognito data to the intermediate bundle format)
then apply (write the bundle to your theauth-go storage backend).

The two-stage design lets your team audit the JSON before committing to any
production writes. The intermediate bundle is human-readable; you can diff it,
fix it, and run `theauth-migrate validate` against it as many times as you like.

## Prerequisites

- `theauth-migrate` binary (build with `go build ./cmd/theauth-migrate`)
- AWS CLI configured for your Cognito user pool
- Postgres DSN for your theauth-go database (or use `--storage memory` for a dry run)

## Step 1: Export users from Cognito

There are two supported input formats:

### Option A: Cognito console CSV export

1. Open the AWS Console and navigate to Cognito.
2. Select your user pool.
3. Go to "Users" and click "Export users to CSV" (or use the CSV download button).
4. Save the file as `cognito-users.csv`.

You can also use the AWS CLI to generate a compatible CSV:

```bash
aws cognito-idp list-users \
  --user-pool-id us-east-1_XXXXXXX \
  --output text \
  --query 'Users[*].[Username,Attributes[?Name==`email`]|[0].Value,Attributes[?Name==`email_verified`]|[0].Value,Attributes[?Name==`sub`]|[0].Value]' \
  > cognito-users.csv
```

Note: the AWS CLI text output format does not match the Cognito console CSV
exactly. Use the console export for the most reliable input, or use the JSON
option below.

### Option B: Cognito JSON export (recommended)

The JSON export from `aws cognito-idp list-users` preserves more attributes
including MFA settings and custom attributes:

```bash
aws cognito-idp list-users \
  --user-pool-id us-east-1_XXXXXXX \
  --output json \
  > cognito-users.json
```

For large user pools, paginate the results:

```bash
next_token=""
output_file="cognito-users-all.json"
echo '{"Users": [' > "$output_file"
first=true

while true; do
  if [ -z "$next_token" ]; then
    result=$(aws cognito-idp list-users \
      --user-pool-id us-east-1_XXXXXXX \
      --max-results 60 \
      --output json)
  else
    result=$(aws cognito-idp list-users \
      --user-pool-id us-east-1_XXXXXXX \
      --max-results 60 \
      --pagination-token "$next_token" \
      --output json)
  fi

  users=$(echo "$result" | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(json.dumps(d.get('Users', []))[1:-1])")
  if [ -n "$users" ]; then
    if [ "$first" = "true" ]; then
      echo "$users" >> "$output_file"
      first=false
    else
      echo ",$users" >> "$output_file"
    fi
  fi

  next_token=$(echo "$result" | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('PaginationToken', ''))" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -z "$next_token" ]; then
    break
  fi
done

echo ']}' >> "$output_file"
```

## Step 2: Convert to the intermediate bundle format

```bash
# From CSV
theauth-migrate cognito --export cognito-users.csv --output bundle.json

# From JSON
theauth-migrate cognito --export cognito-users.json --output bundle.json
```

The tool auto-detects the format from the file extension. Use
`--export-format csv` or `--export-format json` to override.

## Step 3: Inspect the bundle

Open `bundle.json` in your editor. Key things to review:

- `notes`: human-readable caveats. For Cognito, the most important is that
  **Cognito does not export password hashes**. Every user will have
  `"requires_password_reset": true`.
- `users`: check that email addresses look correct and source IDs are present.
- `mfa_enrolled`: users who had MFA will have `"requires_mfa_reenroll": true`
  and a record here. They must re-enroll TOTP on first login.
- `oauth_accounts`: empty for Cognito (Cognito does not export social connections
  in a way that maps directly to theauth-go OAuth accounts).

### Password reset caveat

Cognito stores password hashes using its own internal format and does not
expose them via any API. All migrated users must reset their password on first
login. The bundle will have `"requires_password_reset": true` for every user.

After the apply step, the CLI prints a list of emails that need a reset token.
Wire this to your email service, or call theauth-go's built-in endpoint for
each address:

```bash
POST /auth/email-password/forgot
Content-Type: application/json

{"email": "user@example.com"}
```

You can also automate this with a script that reads the apply output:

```bash
theauth-migrate cognito --input bundle.json --apply --storage postgres \
  --dsn "$DSN" 2>&1 | grep "email=" | while read -r line; do
    email=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/.*email=\([^ ]*\).*/\1/')
    curl -sf -X POST "$THEAUTH_BASE_URL/auth/email-password/forgot" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{\"email\":\"$email\"}"
  done
```

### MFA caveat

Cognito TOTP (SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA) uses secrets that are encrypted inside
Cognito's HSM. They are never accessible via any API.

Users who had TOTP enrolled will have `"requires_mfa_reenroll": true`. When
they next log in, your application should detect this flag (available on the
theauth-go user record metadata or via a separate table you maintain) and
prompt them to re-enroll TOTP via theauth-go's `/auth/totp/enroll` endpoint.

Users who had SMS MFA: theauth-go does not support SMS MFA. Evaluate whether
to use TOTP, WebAuthn, or another second factor for these users.

## Step 4: Validate the bundle

```bash
theauth-migrate validate --input bundle.json
```

This performs all structural checks without touching any storage:
- Duplicate user emails
- Duplicate source IDs
- Orphaned OAuth account rows
- Schema version compatibility

Fix any reported errors before proceeding.

## Step 5: Dry-run apply

```bash
theauth-migrate cognito --input bundle.json --apply --dry-run
```

A dry run validates the bundle and detects conflicts (e.g. emails that already
exist in the target database) without writing anything.

## Step 6: Apply to production

```bash
theauth-migrate cognito --input bundle.json --apply \
  --storage postgres \
  --dsn "postgres://theauth:secret@db.example.com:5432/theauth_prod"
```

The applier:
1. Validates the bundle.
2. Checks for existing users by email (idempotent; duplicates are skipped).
3. Inserts users in batches of 500.
4. Inserts OAuth accounts.
5. Prints a list of emails that need password-reset tokens.

If any row fails, the error is logged and the remaining rows continue.
Partial failures are reported in the exit summary. Re-run the command; it is
safe because duplicate detection prevents double-inserts.

## Step 7: Send password-reset emails

Use the list from step 6 to send reset emails. See the script in step 3 for
an example of how to automate this.

## Step 8: Update your application

1. Update your sign-in flow to point at theauth-go instead of Cognito.
2. If you had custom Cognito triggers (pre-token generation, pre-sign-up,
   etc.), re-implement them as theauth-go middleware or lifecycle hooks.
3. If you had custom Cognito attributes (`custom:*`), they are preserved in
   the bundle's user `metadata` map. Map them to your application's data model
   as appropriate.

## Step 9: Monitor and cutover

1. Run both Cognito and theauth-go in parallel for one login cycle (optional
   but recommended for large migrations).
2. Verify that users can log in via theauth-go.
3. Disable sign-in via Cognito.
4. After 30 days (or your chosen window), delete the Cognito user pool.

## Rollback plan

Because the apply step is read-only with respect to Cognito and only writes
to the theauth-go database, rollback is straightforward:
1. Point your application back at Cognito.
2. Optionally drop the theauth-go user tables and re-apply with a corrected bundle.

## Common issues

### "cannot determine user id (no 'sub' or 'cognito:username' column)"

The CSV export is missing the `sub` or `cognito:username` column. Use the
JSON export format instead, which always includes the `Username` field.

### Large pools (more than 60,000 users)

`aws cognito-idp list-users` is capped at 60 results per page. Use the
pagination script in step 1 option B.

### Custom attributes not appearing in metadata

Ensure the attribute name starts with `custom:` in the Cognito schema. Only
attributes with that prefix are mapped to the bundle's metadata field.
