# Auth hardening

Opt-in and on-by-default protections added on top of the core flows. All
configuration is additive; the zero `Config` keeps working.

## Login throttle

`Config.LoginThrottle` (nil selects defaults, `Disabled: true` opts out).

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GraceFailures` | 3 | Failures per (IP, email) before backoff starts |
| `BaseDelay` / `MaxDelay` | 1s / 15m | First delay, doubled per failure, capped |
| `ResetAfter` | 15m | Idle time after which counts are forgotten |
| `UserMaxFailures` / `UserLockout` | 10 / 15m | Failures against one email from any IP, then lockout |
| `MFAMaxFailures` / `MFALockout` | 5 / 15m | Wrong TOTP or recovery codes per user |
| `Store` | in-memory | Implement `LoginThrottleStore` to persist or share |

The check runs before the user lookup and the password hash, so unknown and
known emails cost the same. The in-memory store sweeps expired entries on
writes and is capped (`MaxEntries`, default 100000). The limiter serializes
read-modify-write inside one process; a shared store across processes is
last-writer-wins, which is acceptable for throttling.

Client IP comes from the connection address. Behind a reverse proxy every
client shares the proxy address for the (IP, email) key, so the per-user
lockout is the control that still bites; terminate or forward accordingly.

Admin override: `a.UnlockUser(ctx, email)` clears the email lockout and the
user's MFA lockout. `a.ResetPasswordAdmin` does the same after a reset.

## MFA

TOTP codes are accepted once. The last used time-step is stored via the
optional `TOTPReplayStorage` capability (`AdvanceTOTPStep`); `storage/memory`
implements it. Without the capability the step is tracked in process memory.
Attempt limits are keyed by user, so opening new pending sessions does not
reset them.

## First-run bootstrap

```go
a, _ := theauth.New(theauth.Config{
    Storage:   store, // must implement UserCountStorage
    Bootstrap: &theauth.BootstrapConfig{},
})
```

While no user exists, `POST /auth/email-password/signup` needs the token in the
`X-Setup-Token` header or a `setupToken` body field. A generated token is
logged once at startup (`SuppressSetupTokenLog` hides it; read it with
`a.SetupToken()`). After the first user exists signup returns 403
`signup_closed` unless `OpenSignupAfterFirstUser` is set. Magic-link account
creation follows the same gate and cannot present a token. `OnFirstUser` is the
place to grant an admin role. `GET /auth/bootstrap/status` returns
`{"needsSetup":bool}`. Token guesses are throttled per client IP.

Recover-admin helper: `a.ResetPasswordAdmin(ctx, email, newPassword)`.

## Email canonicalization

Trim and lowercase everywhere; `Config.EmailNFKC` adds Unicode NFKC folding.
Enable NFKC before data exists: existing mixed-form rows are not rewritten.

## Password policy

`Config.PasswordPolicy`: `MinLength` (12), `MaxBytes` (72), `BreachChecker`
(nil). `&theauth.HIBPBreachChecker{}` sends only a 5 character SHA-1 prefix and
fails open on network errors.

## Error bodies

Auth handlers answer errors as `{"code","message"}` JSON. See `CHANGELOG.md`
for the code list.
