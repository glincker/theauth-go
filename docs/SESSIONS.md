# Session management

Optional features layered on the opaque session. All of them need a storage
that implements `SessionManagementStorage` (and `SessionLinkStorage` for
links); the memory, SQLite, Postgres and MySQL adapters do. `New` returns `ErrStorageMissingCapability`
when a configured feature lacks its capability.

## Config

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionTTL` | 24h | Absolute lifetime. |
| `SessionIdleTimeout` | 0 (off) | Expire a session unused this long. |
| `SessionTouchInterval` | 1m | At most one last-seen write per session per interval. Negative disables. Must be shorter than the idle timeout. |
| `StepUpTTL` | 5m | How long `POST /auth/step-up` elevates a session. |
| `SessionLinks` | nil (off) | Enables session links; requires a `CredentialChecker`. |

Idle precision is the touch interval: a session can outlive its idle limit by
up to one interval.

## End-user routes (RequireAuth)

- `GET /auth/sessions` lists `{id, deviceLabel, ipPrefix, createdAt, lastSeenAt, expiresAt, current}`. IPs are masked to /24 (IPv4) or /48 (IPv6).
- `DELETE /auth/sessions/{id}` revokes one of the caller's sessions (404 for anyone else's).
- `POST /auth/sessions/revoke-others` revokes all but the current one and returns `{revoked: n}`.
- `DELETE /auth/sessions/current` is unchanged.
- `POST /auth/password/change` verifies the current password, revokes every session and sets a fresh cookie.

Admin `GET /admin/v1/organizations/{orgID}/sessions?user_id=` now returns the user's live sessions.

## Rotation

A new token replaces the old one at login (unchanged), MFA completion
(`/auth/totp/verify`, `/auth/totp/recovery`: the pending token dies and a new
cookie is set), and password change. Password reset already revokes all
sessions. `TheAuth.RotateSession` is exported for your own privilege changes.
The Go methods `VerifyTOTP` and `ConsumeRecoveryCode` still return the same
token; only the HTTP routes rotate.

## Step-up

`POST /auth/step-up` with one of:

```json
{"method":"password","password":"..."}
{"method":"totp","code":"123456"}
{"method":"passkey","challenge":"...","assertion":{...}}
```

Passkey: `POST /auth/step-up/passkey/begin` returns `{options, challenge}`; pass
the browser's assertion back as `assertion`. A TOTP code that fails five times
revokes the session, same as the pending-2FA path.

Success sets `Session.ElevatedUntil`. Guard sensitive routes with
`RequireRecentAuth(maxAge)`: it passes when the session logged in or stepped up
within `maxAge`, else 403 `auth.recent_auth_required`. Sessions tied to a
credential (session links) never count their creation time as a login.

## Session links

Enable with `Config.SessionLinks`. Mint on behalf of a user from your own
authorized code:

```go
tok, _, err := a.MintSessionLink(ctx, theauth.MintSessionLinkInput{
    UserID: uid, CredentialID: apiTokenID, // CredentialID optional
})
```

`POST /auth/session-link/consume {"token": tok}` exchanges it, once, for a
session cookie (`ConsumeSessionLink` is the Go form). POST, not GET, so link
previewers cannot burn it.

A session minted with a `CredentialID` is tied to it: `CredentialChecker` runs
at mint, at exchange, and on **every** session validation, with no caching. It
must return `ErrCredentialRevoked` for a revoked, expired or unknown
credential; that revokes the session. Any other error fails the request closed.
Call `RevokeSessionsByCredential` when you revoke the credential to cut
sessions immediately instead of lazily.

## Long-lived streams

`WatchSession(ctx, token, interval)` returns a context cancelled (cause set)
when the session stops validating, including idle expiry and credential
revocation; checks do not count as activity. `WatchSessionMiddleware(interval)`
applies it to a request. It fails closed on any validation error.

## Storage contract

`storagetest.RunSessionManagement` covers list, monotonic touch, bulk revoke,
elevation and single-use link consumption (including a concurrent-consume
race). `storagetest.Run` includes it when the backend implements both
capabilities. The Postgres and MySQL adapters implement them (migration 0018).
