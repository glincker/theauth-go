# Agent identity and revocation

Make every MCP or agent tool call attributable to a person, and make a revoke
take effect on streams that are already open.

## Agent tokens (the short path)

Needs `Config.APITokens`. An agent token is an API token with `kind=agent`,
owned by the human it acts for.

```go
secret, tok, err := a.MintAgentToken(ctx, theauth.MintAgentTokenInput{
    UserID:    user.ID,
    AgentName: "claude-desktop",
    Abilities: []string{"logs:read", "deploy:create"},
    TTL:       30 * time.Minute, // default Config.APITokens.AgentTTL, 1h
})
```

- At mint, every ability must be one the user holds now, otherwise
  `ErrAbilityNotHeld`.
- On every request the token's abilities are cut to what the user holds at
  that moment (`Config.APITokens.UserAbilities`), so a demotion applies on the
  next call. Effective abilities are always the intersection.
- Lifetimes are short by default: `AgentTTL` 1h, capped by `AgentMaxTTL` 24h.
- `POST /auth/tokens` accepts `kind: "agent"` and `agent_name`; listings
  return `kind`, `agentName` and `delegatedBy`.
- Storage adapters persist three new `APIToken` fields: `Kind`, `AgentName`,
  `DelegatedBy` (all optional, empty Kind means personal). The
  `storagetest` suite covers the round trip.

`RequireAbility` attaches a `Principal`. `p.ActorChain()` returns the human
first, then the agent. `EmitAudit` called under that context adds
`actor_agent`, `actor_token_id`, `delegated_by` and `actor_chain` to the event
metadata and attributes `ActorUserID` to the human, so one event records both.

## Agents on the OAuth path

`RegisterAgent` creates an agent under a user and, when `Resource` is set,
the delegation grant for it in one call. Needs `Config.AgentIdentity` and
`Config.AuthorizationServer`.

```go
reg, err := a.RegisterAgent(ctx, theauth.RegisterAgentInput{
    OwnerID: user.ID, Name: "mcp-client",
    Scope: []string{"read"}, Resource: "https://mcp.example.com",
})
// reg.Secret.Secret is shown once; reg.Grant authorises token exchange.
```

Resource servers that authenticate these tokens elsewhere can call
`DelegatedAbilities(ctx, userID, scopes)` for the same intersection.

## Revocation watcher

Events fire when a session, API token, agent, agent credential or delegation
is revoked, and when you call `NotifyOwnerDisabled` for a disabled or deleted
user (the library cannot see your host-side flag). Internal revoke paths
reach the bus through `EmitAudit`, so nothing needs separate wiring.

```go
unsub, _ := a.SubscribeRevocations(func(ev theauth.RevocationEvent) { ... })
```

Callbacks must not block.

### Dropping long-lived connections

```go
r.Use(a.RequireAbility("logs:read"),
      a.WatchRevocationMiddleware(theauth.WatchOptions{PollInterval: 10 * time.Second}))
```

The request context is cancelled with a cause wrapping `ErrCredentialRevoked`.
For a gRPC stream or MCP session, call `a.WatchRevocation(ctx, target, opts)`
with a `RevocationTarget` (`TargetForPrincipal` builds one).

`PollInterval` is a backstop for a missed event. For sessions it reuses
`WatchSession`; for bearer tokens it re-runs token authentication. Leave it
zero to rely on the bus alone.

### Across processes

Set `Config.RevocationBus` to your own `RevocationBus`:

```go
type RevocationBus interface {
    Publish(ctx context.Context, ev RevocationEvent) error
    Subscribe(fn func(RevocationEvent)) (unsubscribe func(), err error)
}
```

Back `Publish` with Postgres `NOTIFY` or Redis `PUBLISH`, and have your
listener call every registered `fn`. The default `MemoryRevocationBus` is
in-process only.

Limits: `RevokeOtherSessions` does not publish (it would also match the kept
session), so use polling for that case.

## MCP resource server example

`ExampleTheAuth_MintAgentToken` (root package) shows a Go tool endpoint with
per-tool ability checks and revocation watching. `mcpresource`'s
`ExampleValidator_Middleware` shows the same for OAuth JWT access tokens,
where `Principal.Subject` is the human and `Principal.ActorChain` the agents.
