# Migration Guide

This document captures the consumer-visible deltas between adjacent
minor and major releases. It complements `CHANGELOG.md` (which is
exhaustive) by focusing on the specific changes a downstream Go module
needs to react to when upgrading.

For the v0.x to v1.0 stability promise see `STABILITY.md`.

## v2.0 to v2.1

**Summary**: PRs #20 through #28 reorganized the root package layout.
The public surface is **byte-stable**: every exported type, function,
method, error sentinel, and constant on `github.com/glincker/theauth-go`
keeps its identifier, signature, and method set. Downstream consumers
compile unchanged after a `go get -u`.

### What you need to do

In the typical case: nothing.

```
go get github.com/glincker/theauth-go@v2.1.0
go mod tidy
go build ./...
```

If your build succeeds, you are done.

### What might surprise you

These are the small edge cases where a consumer can notice the reorg.
None are common; we list them so you can rule them out fast if your
build does break.

#### `go doc` output formatting differs slightly

`go doc github.com/glincker/theauth-go` now renders v2.0 types as type
aliases:

```
type User = models.User
type Session = models.Session
type OAuthClient = models.OAuthClient
```

instead of the inlined struct body. This is the documented Go idiom for
re-exporting a type from an internal package
(`github.com/glincker/theauth-go/internal/models` in this case). The
identity, fields, methods, and JSON tags are unchanged. pkg.go.dev still
renders the full struct because it follows the alias.

If your build tooling parses `go doc` output to enforce API contracts,
upgrade the parser to handle alias lines or pin against `pkg.go.dev`
HTML instead.

#### Unexported root methods removed

PR G deleted seven unused unexported methods on `*TheAuth` that lost
their last in-tree caller during the refactor:

- `(*TheAuth).currentSigningKey`
- `(*TheAuth).publicKeyByKID`
- `(*TheAuth).invalidateClientAuthCache`
- `(*TheAuth).agentBySubjectClaim`
- `(*TheAuth).authenticateClient`
- `(*TheAuth).finishRegistrationFromRequest`
- `(*TheAuth).finishLoginFromRequest`

If your code reaches any of these via `//go:linkname`, `reflect`, or
package-local fork patches, it will fail to build. The fix is to invoke
the corresponding method on the internal service that the forwarder
used to call (or, when the service is in `internal/`, to vendor / fork
the helper you need). The internal flow services
(`internal/as.Service`, `internal/agent.Service`, etc.) expose the
canonical implementations; the root forwarders were thin wrappers.

If you depended on `(*TheAuth).agentBySubjectClaim` specifically, note
that the `AgentLookup` adapter inside `*as.Service` is now wired
directly to `agent.Service.AgentBySubjectClaim` at `theauth.New` time.
Custom AS wiring outside of `theauth.New` should follow the same
pattern.

#### Root file layout reshuffled

If you grep across your dependency tree for symbols defined in
`github.com/glincker/theauth-go/*.go`, the file each symbol lives in
has moved. Examples:

- Password / TOTP / WebAuthn / session / magic-link / audit forwarders
  are in `forwarders_identity.go` (previously
  `service_password.go`, `service_totp.go`, etc.).
- DCR / introspect / revoke / token grants / metadata / authorize are
  in `forwarders_oauth.go`.
- SCIM / organizations / RBAC / delegation are in
  `forwarders_enterprise.go`.
- The OAuth provider, password, TOTP, WebAuthn, and AS mount adapters
  are in `mounts_extracted.go`.

The symbol identifiers are unchanged; only their file location moved.
This affects code search and IDE jump-to-definition, not compilation.

### Storage interfaces

`Storage` and `OAuthServerStorage` are unchanged in v2.1. Custom
adapters built against v2.0 keep working without modification.

### `Mount()` signature

`(*TheAuth).Mount(r chi.Router)` is unchanged. The mount tree (every
route path, every middleware order) is byte-stable with v2.0; the only
difference is which internal package implements each handler.

## v1.0 to v2.0

See `CHANGELOG.md` under `[2.0.0]` for the full additive surface
(OAuth 2.1 AS, RFC 7591 DCR, agent identity, RFC 8693 token exchange,
RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata, `mcpresource` validator).

v2.0 is **additive**: every v1.0 program continues to compile and pass
its tests against v2.0 without changes. The new capability surfaces
behind `Config.AuthorizationServer`, `Config.AgentIdentity`,
`Config.AccountUX`, and the separately-importable
`github.com/glincker/theauth-go/mcpresource` module.

## v0.7 to v1.0

See `CHANGELOG.md` under `[1.0.0] -> Migrating from v0.7` for the
breaking change: `Config.AuditHook` and the synchronous `AuditEvent`
shape were removed; set `Config.Audit = &AuditConfig{}` to enable the
async audit writer. `Storage` gained 16 RBAC and audit methods; custom
implementations built on top of the in-tree `memory` or `postgres`
adapters keep working unchanged.
