# Changelog

All notable changes to theauth-go are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) from v1.0 forward.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`Config.LifecycleHooks` surface (#76, partial).** New optional hook bundle
  lets consumers react to authentication-lifecycle events without forking
  handlers or wrapping endpoints at the HTTP boundary. Six hook fields land
  (`OnSignup`, `OnSignin`, `OnPasswordChange`, `OnMFAEnabled`, `OnTokenIssued`,
  `OnOrgSwitch`), plus `SignupMethod` and `MFAKind` enums. Errors and panics
  are recovered and logged; the triggering request never fails. This release
  wires `OnSignup` and `OnSignin` at the password and magic-link paths.
  The remaining hook points (OAuth, passkey, SAML signup; password change;
  MFA enable; token issuance; org switch) ship incrementally in v2.5.x
  without API change. Magic-link consume distinguishes new vs returning
  users via an internal flag so OnSignup only fires when the user row was
  actually created. See `LifecycleHooks` doc comment for semantics.
- **`Auth.UserByID` (#77, partial).** Public lookup that previously forced
  consumers to reach into storage directly. Forwards to `Storage.UserByID`.

### Fixed

- **`RequireAuth` now emits RFC 7807 problem+json on 401 (#78).** Previously
  `RequireAuth` and `RequirePendingOrFull` wrote plain-text bodies (`"unauthorized"`)
  while `RequirePermission` already emitted RFC 7807, forcing frontends to
  special-case the 401 path. All three middlewares now share a single envelope:

  ```
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  Content-Type: application/problem+json
  WWW-Authenticate: Session realm="theauth", error="auth.unauthenticated"

  {"type":"https://theauth.dev/problems/auth.unauthenticated",
   "title":"Unauthorized","status":401,
   "detail":"Missing or invalid session","code":"auth.unauthenticated"}
  ```

  Two distinct codes are surfaced so frontends can distinguish "log in" from
  "complete second factor":

  - `auth.unauthenticated` for no session cookie or failed validation.
  - `auth.step_up_required` for pending_2fa sessions that still need TOTP or WebAuthn verify.

  `RequirePermission` 500 paths also moved off plain text (`rbac.disabled`,
  `rbac.internal_error`) for the same reason. Tracked in milestone v2.5.0.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-22

The "enterprise security profile, supply chain hardening, and storage portability"
release. v2.4 closes the FAPI 2.0 baseline by combining PAR (RFC 9126), JAR
(RFC 9101), and JWT-Bearer client authentication (RFC 7523) in a single release.
A new MySQL 8.x backend, a public `storagetest` contract suite, CIBA backchannel
authentication (RFC 9509), and a CLI migration tool for Cognito and Auth0 round
out the release. All additions are fully additive: downstream code compiles
unchanged.

### Added

- **MySQL 8.x storage backend (#62).** `storage/mysql` implements `theauth.Storage`
  and `OAuthServerStorage` with full parity with the existing postgres backend.
  The adapter uses `sqlc`-generated queries targeting MySQL 8.x dialect. All
  dialect translations (e.g., `ILIKE` to `LIKE BINARY`, `gen_random_uuid()` to
  `UUID()`, advisory locks to `GET_LOCK`) are handled internally. Enable the
  contract test gate by setting `THEAUTH_MYSQL_CONTRACT=1` when running
  `go test ./storage/mysql/...` against a live MySQL instance. The contract suite
  (`storagetest.Run`) is the same set used by the postgres adapter, so parity
  is enforced mechanically.
  - Current parity caveats: `postgres.Migrate` pattern not yet mirrored; operators
    apply the `storage/mysql/migrations/` SQL files manually or via their
    migration runner. Advisory lock serialization is weaker than Postgres
    serializable transactions; avoid concurrent migrations.

- **Cognito + Auth0 migration CLI (#63).** New `cmd/theauth-migrate/` binary
  with sub-commands `cognito` and `auth0` exports users from AWS Cognito (CSV
  or JSON input) and Auth0 (Management API or bulk export) into an intermediate
  JSON bundle, then applies the bundle to any theauth-go storage backend.
  - Two-stage design: `export` then `apply` lets operators diff and validate
    the bundle with `theauth-migrate validate` before touching production storage.
  - Auth0 path preserves bcrypt password hashes and triggers transparent
    re-hashing with Argon2id on next successful login. Enable with the new
    `PasswordPolicy.AllowLegacyBcrypt = true` config flag during the migration
    window; disable once active users have been re-hashed.
  - Build: `go build ./cmd/theauth-migrate`.

- **PAR (RFC 9126) + JAR (RFC 9101) for FAPI-adjacent profile (#64).**
  Pushed Authorization Requests and JWT-Secured Authorization Requests are now
  supported by the OAuth 2.1 AS.
  - PAR: `POST /oauth/par` accepts the full authorization request body, stores
    it under a `urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri` handle (9-character random
    suffix), and returns the handle with a 60-second TTL. The authorize endpoint
    accepts the `request_uri` parameter and rejects raw parameters when PAR is
    required (`PARConfig.Required = true`).
  - JAR: the authorize endpoint verifies `request` JWTs signed by the client's
    registered public key (`JARConfig.AllowedAlgorithms`, default ES256/RS256).
    The `request` JWT must contain `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, and the
    standard authorization parameters.
  - PAR + JAR together reach the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile baseline when
    combined with the JWT-Bearer client authentication added in #65. See
    the PAR + JAR concept page in the docs site for the flow narrative.
  - New config: `AuthorizationServerConfig.PAR *PARConfig`,
    `AuthorizationServerConfig.JAR *JARConfig`.
  - Passes the zero-dependency mcpresource contract: mcpresource gains no new
    transitive deps from this change.

- **JWT-Bearer client auth + grant + token exchange polish (#65, RFC 7523).**
  The AS now accepts JWT client assertions (`client_assertion_type=
  urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`) as a client
  authentication method alongside `client_secret_post` and `client_secret_basic`.
  - Issuers are registered via the new `TrustedJWTIssuer` config type; a
    `SubjectMapper` callback maps the JWT subject to a theauth client ID.
  - JWT-Bearer grant (`grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`):
    exchange an external JWT (e.g., a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token) for a
    theauth access token without a prior interactive auth step.
  - Token exchange polish: `requested_token_type` parameter is now respected
    per RFC 8693; the response `issued_token_type` is set explicitly.
  - Primary use case: Kubernetes workload identity. A Pod authenticates with
    its projected ServiceAccount token; the AS verifies the OIDC issuer and
    mints a scoped access token for the target resource. See the JWT-Bearer
    concept page in the docs site.
  - New config: `AuthorizationServerConfig.JWTBearer *JWTBearerConfig`.
  - Passes the zero-dependency mcpresource contract: no new transitive deps.

- **CIBA -- backchannel authentication, RFC 9509 (#66, Poll + Ping modes).**
  The CIBA profile lets a consumption device (e.g., a call center agent or voice
  assistant) authenticate a user via a separate authentication device (e.g., a
  phone push notification) without a browser redirect.
  - `AuthenticationDevice` interface: implement `Notify(ctx, req CIBARequest)
    error` to deliver push notifications, voice prompts, or any out-of-band
    channel.
  - Poll mode: the client calls `POST /ciba/token` periodically using the
    `auth_req_id` returned by `POST /ciba/bc-authorize`. Returns
    `authorization_pending` until the user approves (or `access_denied` on
    denial).
  - Ping mode: client registers a `client_notification_endpoint`; theauth-go
    POSTs the token to that endpoint when the user approves. No polling required.
  - When to use: IoT device pairing, voice-channel step-up, call center
    agent-assisted authentication, TV/speaker without a keyboard.
  - New config: `AuthorizationServerConfig.CIBA *CIBAConfig`.

- **`storagetest` public contract suite (#58).** Any custom storage adapter can
  now be verified against the canonical theauth-go contract by calling
  `storagetest.Run(t, factory)` from its test file:
  ```go
  func TestConformance(t *testing.T) {
      storagetest.Run(t, func() theauth.Storage { return mystorage.New() })
  }
  ```
  The suite covers 12 functional areas (sessions, passwords, oauth clients,
  refresh tokens, JWKS rotation, agents, delegations, CIBA, storagetest
  idempotency, error sentinel conformance, concurrent writes, and audit
  append-only). Both in-tree adapters run this suite in CI.

- **`Config.RequireState bool` (#64, RFC 9700 BCP).** When true, the AS rejects
  `/authorize` requests without a non-empty `state` parameter. Default false
  preserves backwards compatibility.

- **`PasswordPolicy.AllowLegacyBcrypt bool` (#63).** Opt-in to accept bcrypt
  password hashes imported from Auth0 (and similar systems). When a user
  authenticates, theauth-go detects the bcrypt PHC prefix, verifies with bcrypt,
  and re-hashes with Argon2id on success. Disable this flag once the migration
  window closes.

### Changed

- **`AuthorizationServerConfig` extended with new optional sub-configs (additive).**
  `PAR *PARConfig`, `JAR *JARConfig`, `JWTBearer *JWTBearerConfig`,
  `CIBA *CIBAConfig`. All nil by default; nil means the feature is disabled.
  Existing config structs compile and run unchanged.

- **Token exchange response now sets `issued_token_type` explicitly (#65).**
  Previously the field was omitted. It is now set to
  `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token` per RFC 8693 section 2.2.1.
  The field was not part of any guarantee in previous releases, so this is
  classified as a bug fix rather than a breaking change.

### Fixed

- **`gofmt` fixup on `jwtbearer.go` and `par_serialise.go` (#68).** Two files
  landed in #64 and #65 with minor formatting inconsistencies. No logic change.

### Tests

- **Root test file count: 35 to 27 (#67).** Extracted
  `internal/theauthtest/` helper package (test fixtures, JWT minting helpers,
  request builders) consumed by the remaining root tests. Reduces root noise
  and makes per-package test helpers importable without init-time side effects.

- **Performance regression CI gate (#59, 12 benchmarks).** `benchgate` now runs
  on every PR. Compares benchmark results with `benchstat`; any benchmark
  regressing beyond the 25% default threshold fails the CI check. The diff is
  posted as a PR comment. Baseline is pinned to the `main` branch. Override
  threshold: `BENCHGATE_THRESHOLD=0.30`.

### Internal

- **Goreleaser + SBOM + Sigstore keyless + SLSA provenance (#57).** Tag pushes
  now trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs goreleaser, generates
  a CycloneDX SBOM, signs the SBOM and source archive with `cosign` keyless
  signing (GitHub Actions OIDC identity), and attaches an SLSA level-3
  provenance attestation. Consumers can verify releases with `cosign verify-blob`
  and `gh attestation verify`. See [Releases and Verification](https://theauth.dev/go/security/releases/).

- **MkDocs Material docs site with `mike` versioning (#60).** `docs-site/` now
  builds a versioned docs site deployed to GitHub Pages. The `mike` plugin
  manages version aliases (`latest`, `stable`). The GH Pages workflow deploys
  on every push to `main`. Build locally: `cd docs-site && mkdocs build --strict`.

### Security

- **Supply chain: goreleaser + cosign + SLSA (#57).** Every release artifact
  (source archive, SBOM) is now signed with Sigstore keyless signing via the
  GitHub Actions OIDC identity. SLSA level-3 provenance is attached. Consumers
  can cryptographically verify that a release was built by the official GitHub
  Actions workflow and has not been tampered with post-build. See
  [Releases and Verification](https://theauth.dev/go/security/releases/) for the
  verification commands.

- **Trust documentation (#61).** `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md` (STRIDE analysis across
  all subsystems), `docs/COMPLIANCE-SOC2.md` (AICPA TSC 2017 criteria mapping),
  and `docs/COMPLIANCE-GDPR.md` (GDPR data handling reference and
  operator/controller role clarification) are now in the repository. These
  documents inform operator security assessments and SOC 2 evidence packs.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-22

The "MCP wedge deepening and enterprise feature parity" release. Three major
features land here that close the gap with Auth0, Clerk, and Better-Auth:
account linking with mandatory step-up, eight new built-in OAuth providers
(12 total), and pluggable SIEM streaming sinks for enterprise audit log
shipping. Public API stays additive; downstream code compiles unchanged.

### Added

- **Account linking and identity merge (#55).** Users can now bind a new
  authentication method to an existing account, or merge two accounts into
  one, behind mandatory step-up auth.
  - `LinkOAuthToCurrentUser(ctx, sessionID, provider, payload) error` --
    bind a new OAuth provider to the signed-in user.
  - `LinkPasswordToCurrentUser(ctx, sessionID, password) error` -- add a
    backup password to an OAuth-only account.
  - `MergeAccounts(ctx, primaryID, secondaryID, mergeInput) error` --
    destructive merge; moves OAuth accounts, passwords, WebAuthn
    credentials, TOTP secrets from secondary to primary; revokes
    secondary's sessions; cross-references via `merged_into` in the audit
    log.
  - HTTP endpoints under `/account/identities`: POST `/oauth`, GET
    `/oauth/callback`, POST `/password`, POST `/merge`, DELETE
    `/{provider}`.
  - New errors: `ErrIdentityConflict`, `ErrStepUpRequired`,
    `ErrLastAuthMethod` (cannot unlink the last auth method).
  - New audit event types: `identity.linked`, `identity.unlinked`,
    `account.merged`.
  - All methods require a fully-authenticated session (no `pending_2fa`);
    callers receive `ErrStepUpRequired` otherwise.

- **Eight new built-in OAuth providers (#54). Total provider count: 4 to 12.**
  - `provider/apple` -- Sign in with Apple. ES256 JWT client authentication
    minted from a .p8 private key per token exchange. Parse the .p8 file
    with `x509.ParsePKCS8PrivateKey` after `pem.Decode`, not
    `x509.ParseECPrivateKey` (the file is downloadable only once from
    Apple's developer console).
  - `provider/facebook` -- Meta OAuth 2.0 with PKCE; `email_verified`
    conservatively false (Graph API does not attest it).
  - `provider/slack` -- Sign in with Slack via the OpenID Connect
    endpoint.
  - `provider/gitlab` -- GitLab OIDC; `BaseURL` option supports
    self-hosted instances.
  - `provider/bitbucket` -- Bitbucket Cloud OAuth 2.0 with HTTP Basic
    auth on the token exchange per Atlassian spec.
  - `provider/twitch` -- Twitch OIDC; adds the `claims` parameter to
    surface email on the userinfo response.
  - `provider/linkedin` -- Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect
    (post-2023 `/v2/userinfo` endpoint).
  - `provider/x` -- X (formerly Twitter) OAuth 2.0 with mandatory PKCE;
    `ExchangeCode` returns an error if `codeVerifier` is empty.
  - Each provider ships with its own `examples/oauth-<provider>/`
    minimal demo.

- **SIEM audit streaming sinks (#53).** New `AuditSink` interface on the
  root package lets operators fan out audit events to external systems
  without a polling job. Failed sinks never block the canonical storage
  write; failures increment `Stats.AuditSinkFailed`.
  - `AuditSink` interface: `Stream(ctx, batch []AuditEvent) error` +
    `Name() string`.
  - `AuditConfig.Sinks []AuditSink` -- register zero or more sinks; root
    package wires them through `wiring.go`.
  - Built-in `audit/sinks/otlp` -- OTLP/HTTP logs exporter; deps in its
    own go.mod (root gains zero new transitive deps).
  - Built-in `audit/sinks/splunkhec` -- Splunk HEC envelope, token auth,
    no new deps.
  - Built-in `audit/sinks/webhook` -- generic CloudEvents 1.0 POST with
    `X-CloudEvents-Signature` HMAC-SHA256 header.
  - All three sinks support a `WithRedactor(func(AuditEvent) AuditEvent)`
    option for per-sink PII stripping (stricter than the default).
  - New stats field: `Stats.AuditSinkFailed uint64`.

### Changed

- **Stats counters expanded.** `Stats.AuditSinkFailed` added; existing
  counters unchanged. Per the additive-fields contract, downstream code
  consuming Stats does not need to change.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-22

The "production-grade observability and audit closure" release. Three RFC-level
features (CIMD, DPoP, observability adapters), four security closures, four perf
items, +175pp of direct handler coverage on two highest-blast-radius packages,
and an architectural cleanup that brings `theauth.go` from 1,171 LOC under the
500 LOC ceiling. Public API stays byte-stable; every addition is additive.

### Added

- **OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) per MCP spec 2025-11-25 (#42).**
  Clients identify themselves by HTTPS URL; theauth-go fetches and validates
  the metadata JSON on first use, caches with TTL, and applies a configurable
  trust policy. Default policy is `DenyAll` (fail-closed) for fresh deployments.
  Demotes the RFC 7591 DCR registration flow without removing it.

- **RFC 9449 DPoP (Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession) support (#43).** The
  authorization server can now mint sender-constrained access tokens.
  Enable by setting `Config.AuthorizationServer.DPoP = &DPoPConfig{...}`.
  When a client presents a `DPoP` header on the token request, the AS
  verifies the proof JWT (typ, alg, jwk, htm, htu, iat, jti, optional
  nonce) and embeds an RFC 7800 `cnf.jkt` claim in the issued access
  token. The response carries `token_type: "DPoP"` per RFC 9449.
  Resource servers wired with `mcpresource.WithDPoPVerification(...)`
  re-verify the proof on every request, including the `ath` claim that
  binds the proof to the access token. A stolen token cannot be replayed
  without the holder's private key.
  - New public type: `theauth.DPoPConfig` (additive on
    `AuthorizationServerConfig`; nil by default).
  - New mcpresource option: `mcpresource.WithDPoPVerification(algs,
    proofMaxAge, jtiReplayWindow)`. The mcpresource module gains no new
    transitive dependencies.
  - AS metadata now advertises `dpop_signing_alg_values_supported`.
  - Supported proof algs: ES256, ES384, RS256, PS256, EdDSA. HS* and
    `none` are unconditionally rejected.
  - Deferred (forward-compatible): authorization-code binding,
    refresh-token DPoP rotation.

- **Pluggable observability adapters (OTel + Prometheus) (#44).** New
  `Tracer` and `Metrics` interfaces on the root package plus a coalesced
  `Hooks` bundle wired via `Config.Observability`. 10 spans
  (`theauth.oauth.token`, `theauth.oauth.introspect`, agent + delegation
  lifecycle, etc.) and 10 metrics
  (`theauth_oauth_token_latency_seconds{grant_type}`, clientauthcache
  hits/misses/size, ratelimit blocked, audit queue depth, etc.) ship live.
  Example bridges to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` and `prometheus/client_golang`
  live in `examples/observability-otel/` and `examples/observability-prom/`
  with their own go.mod; root and `mcpresource` go.mod gain zero new deps.

- **Storage migration helper (#32).** `postgres.Migrate(ctx, pool) error`
  embeds the migration SQL files, applies pending versions under an
  advisory lock, and is idempotent on re-run. Downstream consumers can
  delete their own copies of the migration code.

- **`Config.RequireState` knob (#45).** When true, rejects `/authorize`
  requests without a non-empty `state` parameter. Default false preserves
  backwards compatibility. RFC 9700 best-current-practice.

- **`Config.SuppressSecureCookieWarning` knob (#48).** Opt-out for the
  deprecation warning shipped this release ahead of v3.0 default flip of
  `SecureCookie` from `false` to `true`.

- **`mcpresource.Validator.Diagnostics()` (#48).** Returns warnings about
  validator misconfiguration (e.g., neither JWKS URL nor introspect URL
  set). New public types: `mcpresource.Diagnostic`, severity constants.

- **`AuthorizationServerNotConfigured` sentinel error (#50).** Replaces
  six ad-hoc `errors.New(...)` calls in `forwarders_oauth.go`. Use
  `errors.Is(err, theauth.ErrAuthorizationServerNotConfigured)`.

### Changed

- **`theauth.go` LOC: 1,171 -> 383 (#50).** Wiring extracted to `wiring.go`,
  storage interface to `storage.go`, config sub-structs to `config.go`.
  OAuth provider state machine moved to `internal/oauth/service.go`.
  `internal/account/handlers/` and `internal/admin/handlers/` parent
  packages collapsed (handlers now live directly under `internal/account/`
  and `internal/admin/`). Zero public-API impact; downstream code compiles
  unchanged.

- **JWKS rotation is now transactional (#48).** Migration `0015` adds a
  partial unique index `WHERE state='current'`. `Service.RotateSigningKey`
  serializes rotations within a process via a `sync.Mutex`; concurrent
  rotations across processes are guaranteed to leave exactly one current
  key by the database constraint. New optional storage interface
  `JWKSAtomicRotator` lets postgres collapse the rotation into a single
  serializable transaction.

- **Audit redactor uses precomputed lowercase key set (#46).** Replaces
  per-key `strings.ToLower` allocations with `strings.EqualFold` against a
  set built once at construction. Allocs/op drop.

- **`keyedLimiter` uses `sync.RWMutex` + atomic `lastUsed` (#46).** Read
  path no longer needs the write lock; 8-core read-heavy throughput
  improves 5-10x under contention.

- **Chain-walk cache (5s TTL) (#46).** `chainStillActive` cached per agent;
  3+ storage calls per 3-deep chain drop to ~0 within the TTL window.
  Suspend / revoke invalidates the cache via the same plumbing as
  `clientauthcache`.

- **SCIM auth uses a single storage lookup (#46).** `AuthenticateSCIMToken`
  returns the token row; middleware reads from it directly.
  `TouchSCIMTokenLastUsed` runs async via the audit channel-writer pattern.

### Fixed

- **Magic-link endpoint is now rate-limited (#45).** `POST /auth/magic-link`
  applies the same `ipLimit` and `emailLimit` middleware buckets as the
  password endpoints. Was previously the only credential-touching route
  without rate limiting (enumeration vector).

- **PKCE verifier comparison is constant-time (#45).** Replaced `!=` with
  `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` in `internal/as/token.go`.

- **`RevokeToken` walks the refresh family (#45).** A revoke now invalidates
  the entire token family via the same `RevokeRefreshTokenFamily` helper
  used by the replay-detection path. RFC 7009 "unknown token returns 200"
  semantics preserved.

- **`InsertOAuthClient` coerces nil text[] slices to empty arrays (#40).**
  Fixes `SQLSTATE 23502 violates not-null constraint` when a caller mints
  an OAuth client with zero-value `RedirectURIs`, `GrantTypes`,
  `ResponseTypes`, or `Contacts`. Most common hit: `CreateAgent` calling
  `MintAgentCredential` on a fresh schema. Same fix applied to
  `UpdateOAuthClient`.

### Tests

- **`internal/saml/handlers` 0% -> 91.4% statement coverage (#47).** 20
  direct table tests covering happy path, signature failure, expired
  `NotOnOrAfter`, wrong audience, and replay on `/saml/acs`. Plus 15
  tests for the 5 CRUD endpoints.

- **`internal/webauthn/handlers` 0% -> 84.5% (#47).** 21 tests covering
  challenge cookie roundtrip, single-use guarantee, register/login Begin
  and Finish, and credentials list / delete.

- **`internal/organizations/handlers` 0% -> 94.0% (#49).** 22 tests for
  the 7 endpoints (create / list / get / activate / clear-active /
  add-member / remove-member) with happy paths and all documented error
  codes.

- **`internal/admin/handlers` 0% -> 81.1% (#49).** 52 tests for
  `requireOrgMatch` middleware plus the 12 admin endpoints.

- **`TestSuspendAgentBustsClientAuthCache` regression guard.** Confirms a
  suspended agent cannot re-authenticate via a cached Argon2 entry within
  the 5-minute cache TTL.

- **`TestJWKSRotationConcurrentSafe` (#48).** 8 goroutines rotate the
  signing key; asserts exactly one `state=current` row at the end.

### Internal

- **PR H1 (#41) test relocation.** 19 root-level `*_test.go` files moved
  into their proper internal packages, ahead of the architectural
  cleanup in #50.

- **`/go.work` lists all 8 examples (#44 follow-up).** Adds `chi-app`,
  `echo-app`, `gin-app`, `mcp-server`, `oauth-multi-provider`,
  `stdlib-app`, `observability-otel`, `observability-prom`.

### Security

- **N1 (security re-audit).** Cache invalidation gap: revoked / suspended
  agents could authenticate via a cached Argon2 entry for up to 5 minutes.
  Closed by an explicit `s.invalidate(cur.ClientID)` call in
  `changeAgentStatus`. Regression test ships.

- **L1-L3 + L5 (security re-audit).** All re-audit lows closed; see Added
  / Fixed entries for #45 above.

- **M3-M5 (security re-audit).** SecureCookie deprecation warning, JWKS
  transactional rotation, mcpresource Diagnostics; see entries for #48.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-21

Internal architecture reorganization plus the v2.0 security audit followups.
**The public API is byte-stable with v2.0**: every exported type, function,
and method on `*theauth.TheAuth` keeps the same identifier, signature, and
method set. Downstream consumers compile unchanged. Anyone relying on
unexported symbols via `//go:linkname` or unsafe reflection may break (we
deleted several dead unexported root methods and consolidated forwarders).

### Internal package reorganization (PRs #20 through #28)

The 1.9k-line monolithic root grew to 49 non-test root files at v2.0; PRs
#20 through #28 extracted feature-by-feature implementations into
`internal/<flow>` subpackages while the root kept the public surface as
thin forwarders. PR G (this release) collapsed the remaining one-line
forwarders into four grouped files and removed the dead bridges that
earlier extractions left behind.

- New internal packages added across the refactor: `internal/models`,
  `internal/as`, `internal/as/handlers`, `internal/agent`,
  `internal/agent/handlers`, `internal/delegation`, `internal/session`,
  `internal/password`, `internal/password/handlers`, `internal/totp`,
  `internal/totp/handlers`, `internal/webauthn`, `internal/webauthn/handlers`,
  `internal/magiclink`, `internal/oauth/handlers`, `internal/saml`,
  `internal/saml/handlers`, `internal/scim`, `internal/scim/handlers`,
  `internal/organizations`, `internal/organizations/handlers`,
  `internal/rbac`, `internal/audit`, `internal/account/handlers`,
  `internal/admin/handlers`, `internal/clientauthcache`,
  `internal/jwt`, `internal/chain`, `internal/httpx`, `internal/wavt`,
  `internal/ulid`, `internal/bench`, `internal/samltest`.
- Root non-test `.go` file count: 49 (v2.0) to 28 (v2.1). Public surface
  unchanged.

### Dead code purge (PR G)

PR G deleted seven unused unexported root methods that lost their last
in-tree caller during PRs B through F. Every one was forwarded to a
`*as.Service` or `*<flow>.Service` method that handler packages now reach
directly. None were on the public surface; consumers are unaffected.

- `(*TheAuth).currentSigningKey` (was in `jwks.go`)
- `(*TheAuth).publicKeyByKID` (was in `jwks.go`)
- `(*TheAuth).invalidateClientAuthCache` (was in `as.go`)
- `(*TheAuth).agentBySubjectClaim` (was in `service_agent.go`); the
  `AgentLookup` adapter wired in `theauth.New` now points at
  `a.agentSvc.AgentBySubjectClaim` directly.
- `(*TheAuth).authenticateClient` (was in `service_token.go`)
- `(*TheAuth).finishRegistrationFromRequest` (was in
  `service_webauthn.go`); every handler now wraps the body in
  `http.MaxBytesReader` itself.
- `(*TheAuth).finishLoginFromRequest` (was in `service_webauthn.go`)

### Forwarder consolidation (PR G)

Twenty-one `service_*.go` forwarder files became three grouped files plus
three substantive service files preserved as-is (because they still hold
local logic, not just one-line thunks).

- `forwarders_identity.go`: session, magic-link, password, TOTP,
  WebAuthn, audit.
- `forwarders_oauth.go`: DCR, introspect, revoke, token, token v3 / v4
  grants, AS metadata, protected-resource metadata, authorize.
- `forwarders_enterprise.go`: SCIM, organizations, RBAC, delegation.
- Retained: `service_oauth.go` (OAuth state cache + GC + provider flow),
  `service_agent.go` (`validateAgentConfig` plus the agent CRUD
  forwarders), `service_saml.go` (`toInternal` adapter plus SAML
  forwarders).

Twelve root `handlers_*.go` files became eight: the five thinnest mount
forwarders (oauth, password, totp, webauthn, oauth_server) collapsed
into `mounts_extracted.go`; the six handler files that carry substantive
service adapters (`handlers_account.go`, `handlers_admin.go`,
`handlers_admin_agents.go`, `handlers_organizations.go`,
`handlers_saml.go`, `handlers_scim.go`) plus the top-level `handlers.go`
stay separate.

`errors_v20.go` merged into `errors.go`; `models_v20.go` merged into
`models.go`.

### Security (audit 2026-06-20, shipped in PR #17)

- H1: POST `/oauth/register` Bearer gate now validates the supplied token
  against `AuthorizationServerConfig.RegistrationTokens` under
  `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` against pre-hashed sha256 digests.
  The legacy "any non-empty bearer is accepted" behavior is gone. Empty
  and unknown bearers return 401 access_denied. When `RegistrationTokens`
  is empty and `AllowAnonymousRegistration` is false (the default and
  production-recommended state), all registration requests are denied.
- H2: POST `/oauth/register` is now rate limited per source IP. The cap
  defaults to 1 req/min when `AllowAnonymousRegistration` is true (the
  documented public-MCP profile) and 5 req/min otherwise. Operators can
  override via the new
  `AuthorizationServerConfig.RegistrationRateLimitPerMinute` field;
  negative values disable the cap entirely.
- H3: organization-scoped delegation admin (POST
  `/admin/v1/organizations/{orgID}/delegations`) now verifies that
  `body.userId` is a member of the calling admin's organization before
  creating the grant.
- H4: `X-Forwarded-For` is no longer trusted by default. The new
  `Config.TrustedProxies []netip.Prefix` field gates XFF: the header is
  consulted only when the incoming `r.RemoteAddr` is inside one of the
  configured prefixes.
- M2: `AddOrganizationMember` now refuses to demote the last owner of an
  organization.
- M6: the email + password signin path pays the Argon2id verify cost on
  the user-not-found and password-empty branches by verifying against a
  fixed dummy PHC hash synthesized once at `New` time.

### Reliability (PR #18)

- Closed the handleToken / SCIM PATCH / end-to-end AS to mcpresource
  reliability gaps surfaced by the 2026-06 test audit.

### Performance (PR #19)

- `clientauthcache` interposes between the AS handlers and the Argon2id
  client_secret verifier. First verification pays the Argon2id cost; every
  subsequent verification of the same `(client_id, secret_hash)` pair is
  served from the cache until the secret rotates or the entry ages out.
- JWKS key cache: the AES-decrypted Ed25519 private key is decrypted once
  per signing key version (rotation refreshes it) and stashed on
  `*as.Service`. Cold path is unchanged; hot path drops one AES decrypt
  per JWT mint.
- `mcpresource` validator switched from `sync.Mutex` to `sync.RWMutex` on
  the JWKS + introspection caches so concurrent reads no longer serialize.

### Removed in PR G

- Seven unused unexported methods on `*TheAuth` (see "Dead code purge"
  above).
- Twenty-one `service_*.go` files merged into three `forwarders_*.go`
  files (see "Forwarder consolidation").
- Five `handlers_*.go` files merged into one `mounts_extracted.go`.
- `errors_v20.go` merged into `errors.go`.
- `models_v20.go` merged into `models.go`.

### Deferred from the 2026-06-20 audit

Tracked as follow-up issues: M1 (SCIM cross-tenant email fallback), M3
(SecureCookie default), M4 (JWKS rotation transaction), M5 (mcpresource
missing-introspection startup warning), L1-L5, I1-I7.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-20

v2.0 ships the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server, agent identity and
delegation chains (RFC 8693), and the `mcpresource` validator SDK for MCP
servers. Three alpha tags shipped phases incrementally
(`v2.0.0-alpha.1` through `v2.0.0-alpha.3`); `v2.0.0` consolidated them.

### Added in v2.0 phase 5 + 6 (targeted for `v2.0.0`)

- New separately importable Go module: `github.com/glincker/theauth-go/mcpresource`.
  Zero dependencies outside the standard library: a consumer importing the
  package does not transitively pull theauth core or the storage adapters.
  Public surface: `Validator`, `Principal`, `Option`, `New`,
  `PrincipalFromContext`, `WithJWKS`, `WithIntrospection`, `WithCacheTTL`,
  `WithHTTPClient`, `WithClockSkew`, `(*Validator).Middleware`,
  `(*Validator).Principal`. Validates JWT signature against a cached JWKS
  (refreshes on kid miss and at the configured cache TTL), enforces the
  audience claim against the configured resource URI, checks expiry, nbf,
  and iat with a 60 second skew tolerance by default, and walks the RFC 8693
  `act` chain via the AS introspection endpoint so revocations propagate
  inside the configured cache window. On any failure the middleware emits
  HTTP 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token",
  resource_metadata="..."` per RFC 6750 + RFC 9728.
- RFC 9728 OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata: the AS exposes
  `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (bare path returns the first
  configured resource) and `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/{path}`
  (per-resource discovery for multi-resource deployments). The document
  carries `resource`, `authorization_servers`, `bearer_methods_supported`,
  plus `scopes_supported`, `resource_name`, `jwks_uri`, and
  `resource_signing_alg_values_supported`.
- Organization-scoped admin UX under `/admin/v1/organizations/{orgID}`:
  `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /agents` and
  `GET/POST/DELETE /delegations`. Gated by the new seeded permissions
  `agents:admin` and `delegations:admin`; both are added to the owner and
  admin default org roles.
- End-user self-service UX under `/account` (enabled via
  `Config.AccountUX`): `GET/POST /agents`, `DELETE /agents/{id}`,
  `GET/POST /delegations`, `POST /delegations/{id}/revoke`. Session-cookie
  gated; cross-user calls return 404 to avoid leaking record existence.
- New seeded RBAC permissions: `agents:admin`, `delegations:admin`.
  Existing consumers see the additional permissions on the next
  `SeedPermissions` call; downstream role definitions that did not pre-grant
  them stay valid (catalog only grows).
- New error sentinels: `ErrAccountUXRequiresAgents`.
- Example `examples/mcp-server/`: standalone runnable demo of the
  mcpresource middleware on a tiny chi server. Shows the one-import claim:
  middleware wiring plus principal extraction in roughly ten lines of Go.
- Audit emission additions: every admin and account mutation emits the same
  events used by the service layer (`agent.created`, `agent.suspended`,
  `agent.resumed`, `agent.revoked`, `agent_credential.minted`,
  `agent_credential.revoked`, `delegation.granted`, `delegation.revoked`).
  No new action names introduced in this PR; the v2.0 phase 3 + 4 catalog
  remains the source of truth.

### v2.0 capability summary

- Phase 1 + 2 (`v2.0.0-alpha.1`): OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server core.
  `/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/revoke`, `/oauth/introspect`,
  `/oauth/register`, `/oauth/jwks`, `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
  RFC 9068 EdDSA JWT access tokens. RFC 8707 mandatory audience binding.
  PKCE S256 mandatory. RFC 9700 refresh rotation with family revocation.
  RFC 7591 dynamic client registration.
- Phase 3 + 4 (`v2.0.0-alpha.2`): agent identity and delegation chains.
  Agents (user or org owned) with one-shot client secrets. Delegation grants
  per `(user, agent, resource)`. `client_credentials` grant for agent
  self-tokens. RFC 8693 token-exchange grant with strict scope narrowing,
  strict duration tightening, and a hard chain-depth cap of 3.
  Introspection walks the actor chain on every call.
- Phase 5 + 6 (`v2.0.0`): the consumption side and the operator surface.
  `mcpresource` SDK for MCP servers. RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata.
  Admin and end-user routes for agent and delegation lifecycle.

### Added in v2.0 phase 3 + 4 (released as `v2.0.0-alpha.2`)

- Agents: `Agent`, `AgentCredential`, `AgentOwner`, `CreateAgentInput`,
  `AgentSecret` models. `CreateAgent`, `MintAgentCredential`,
  `RotateAgentSecret`, `ListAgentsByOwner`, `GetAgent`, `SuspendAgent`,
  `ResumeAgent`, `RevokeAgent` service methods. Agent credential kinds:
  `secret` (Argon2id-hashed), `x509`, `jwk`. The X.509 and JWK kinds return
  `ErrNotImplemented` in this phase so callers see a typed error.
- Delegations: `DelegationGrant`, `GrantDelegationInput` models.
  `GrantDelegation`, `ListDelegationsForUser`, `ListDelegationsForAgent`,
  `RevokeDelegation` service methods. Uniqueness on `(user_id, agent_id,
  resource)` enforced at the database layer. Revoking a grant invalidates
  every derived token at the next introspection refresh.
- Grants on `/oauth/token`:
  - `client_credentials` mints an agent self-token (`sub=agent:<id>`,
    `aud` bound to the supplied resource).
  - `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` (RFC 8693) accepts a
    user (or agent) `subject_token` plus an agent `actor_token`, looks up
    the matching delegation grant, and mints a new JWT with the nested
    `act` chain (RFC 8693 section 4.1). Chain depth is capped at 3; deeper
    chains are rejected with `invalid_request` "actor chain depth exceeded".
- Introspection now walks the full `act` chain on every call and re-checks
  the delegation grant. Any inactive actor or revoked grant flips
  `active=false`, even on a cache hit.
- AS metadata advertises `client_credentials` and the token-exchange URN in
  `grant_types_supported` whenever `Config.AgentIdentity` is configured.
- Audit emissions added: `agent.created`, `agent.suspended`, `agent.resumed`,
  `agent.revoked`, `agent_credential.minted`, `agent_credential.revoked`,
  `agent.token_minted`, `delegation.granted`, `delegation.revoked`,
  `token.exchanged`.
- Migrations: `0012_agents.up.sql` (agents + agent_credentials),
  `0013_delegations.up.sql` (delegation_grants + audit_events.actor_agent_id).
  Down migrations included.
- Storage interface: `OAuthServerStorage` extended with agent + delegation
  methods. v1.0 root `Storage` interface unchanged. Both in-tree adapters
  (memory + postgres) implement the new methods.
- Errors: `ErrAgentNotFound`, `ErrAgentInactive`, `ErrDelegationNotFound`,
  `ErrDelegationRevoked`, `ErrChainDepthExceeded`, `ErrSubjectTokenInvalid`,
  `ErrActorTokenInvalid`, `ErrNotImplemented`, `ErrAgentRequiresAS`,
  `ErrAgentChainDepthTooHigh`.

### Added in v2.0 phase 1 + 2 (released as `v2.0.0-alpha.1`)

- OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server with `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`,
  `/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token` (authorization_code + refresh_token),
  `/oauth/revoke`, `/oauth/introspect`, `/oauth/register` (RFC 7591 dynamic
  client registration), `/oauth/jwks` (Ed25519, 30 day rotation). Mandatory
  PKCE S256; mandatory RFC 8707 resource binding; RFC 9068 JWT access
  tokens; RFC 9700 refresh-token rotation with family revocation.
- New config: `AuthorizationServer *AuthorizationServerConfig`. New
  storage extension interface `OAuthServerStorage`. Migrations 0011
  (oauth_clients + authorization_codes + refresh_tokens) and 0014
  (jwks_keys); 0012 / 0013 reserved as placeholders for phase 3 + 4.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-20

First production-ready release. Public API frozen per STABILITY.md. From
v1.0 forward, breaking changes require a major bump; minor releases add
optional config fields, new methods, new error sentinels, new audit
actions, and new `Stats` fields without breaking existing callers.

### v0.1 to v1.0 capability summary

- Magic-link sign-in, opaque sessions, pluggable `Storage` (memory + postgres).
- Email + password with Argon2id, password reset via single-use token.
- OAuth 2.0 + OIDC with PKCE S256; built-in GitHub, Google, Microsoft, Discord.
- WebAuthn / passkey registration and discoverable login.
- TOTP second factor with salted SHA-256 recovery codes; session step-up via `pending_2fa`.
- SAML 2.0 Service Provider for enterprise IdPs (per-connection + per-org).
- SCIM 2.0 Users + Groups with eq-only filter and RFC 7644 PATCH.
- Organization multi-tenancy with `active_organization_id` session scope.
- Organization-scoped RBAC with a closed permission catalog and seeded roles.
- Append-only audit log with async batched writes, default redactor, keyset cursor read API.
- Admin HTTP API at `/admin/v1` with RFC 7807 problem+json errors.
- Fuzz tests, race-clean test suite, godoc with examples, finalized `STABILITY.md`.

### Added in 1.0

- RBAC: `permissions`, `roles`, `role_permissions`, `user_roles` tables and the
  matching `Storage` methods. `(*TheAuth).RequirePermission` middleware with a
  per-request cache. `SeedPermissions`, `SeedOrganizationRoles`,
  `GrantRole`, `RevokeRole`, `CreateRole`, `UpdateRole`, `DeleteRole`,
  `PermissionsForUser`, `HasPermission`. Twelve seeded permission constants
  plus the system `super_admin` role (granted out-of-band only).
- Audit log: `audit_events` table with org / actor / action DESC indexes.
  `(*TheAuth).EmitAudit` is non-blocking; the writer goroutine drains in
  batches and flushes on `Close` with a configurable timeout. `Stats`
  exposes four atomic counters (`AuditEmitted`, `AuditWritten`,
  `AuditDropped`, `AuditFailed`). `DefaultRedactor` masks
  `password / secret / token / code / refresh_token / access_token` at any
  nesting depth. Twenty-plus canonical actions emitted across every
  state-changing handler in theauth.
- Admin API: twelve endpoints under `/admin/v1` (overridable via
  `AdminConfig.PathPrefix`). Every endpoint requires `RequireAuth` plus a
  catalog `RequirePermission`. Errors are `application/problem+json` per
  RFC 7807 with a stable `code` extension; keyset pagination on the audit
  read endpoint.
- `(*TheAuth).Start` spawns the writer goroutine; `New` invokes `Start`
  automatically so existing callers do not change. `Close` drains the
  writer with a default 5 second deadline.
- New errors: `ErrAdminRequiresRBAC`, `ErrForbidden`, `ErrUnknownPermission`,
  `ErrRoleInUse`, `ErrNoActiveOrg`, `ErrOrgMismatch`, `ErrRBACDisabled`.
- New `admin` subpackage: RFC 7807 `Write` helper, `Problem` type, keyset
  cursor `EncodeCursor` / `DecodeCursor` codec, reserved problem code
  constants.
- Migrations 0009 (rbac) and 0010 (audit) added under
  `storage/postgres/migrations/`.

### Tradeoffs documented

- Audit writes are async; backpressure drops events with
  `Stats.AuditDropped` incremented. Block-on-backpressure would degrade
  authentication latency under spikes; this is the documented choice.
- Audit insert failures are not retried; `Stats.AuditFailed` is the ops
  signal. A persistent retry queue is an order of magnitude more
  complexity than v1.0 wants to absorb; SOC 2 evidence is better served
  by an external audit sink (planned for v1.x).
- No wildcard permissions in v1.0 (planned for v1.1); the catalog is a
  closed set so the permission check is a single set membership.
- ABAC, hierarchical roles, and time-bound permissions are explicitly
  deferred to v1.x.

### Migrating from v0.7

- `Config.AuditHook` and the synchronous `AuditEvent` shape are removed.
  Set `Config.Audit = &AuditConfig{}` to enable the async writer; existing
  no-op deployments leave it nil and see no behavior change.
- `Storage` gains 16 new methods (14 RBAC + 2 audit). Custom adapters
  built on top of `memory` or `postgres` keep working; in-tree custom
  implementations must implement the new methods. Per the new
  `Storage`-extension rule (STABILITY.md), v1.x will introduce future
  persistence operations behind optional interfaces detected via type
  assertion so this kind of break does not happen again.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added (v0.7)

- SAML 2.0 Service Provider on top of `github.com/crewjam/saml` v0.5.1.
  Per-connection IdP binding stored in `saml_connections`, signed
  assertions only (raw-XML signature gate before parse), find-or-create
  by `(connection_id, name_id)` with an email fallback, AuthnRequest
  replay tracking with a configurable TTL. Public-facing flow at
  `/auth/saml/{connectionId}/{login,acs,metadata}`. Per-organization
  connection CRUD at `/auth/orgs/{orgId}/saml/connections`.
- SCIM 2.0 provisioning (RFC 7643 + RFC 7644). Users + Groups CRUD,
  discovery endpoints (`ServiceProviderConfig`, `ResourceTypes`,
  `Schemas`), eq-only filter parser, RFC 7644 PATCH (add / replace /
  remove). Bearer auth with sha256-hashed 256-bit tokens, HTTPS
  enforcement, per-organization isolation, idempotent upsert by
  `externalId`. PUT returns 405 (documented deviation; Okta and Azure AD
  default to PATCH). Endpoints live under `/scim/v2/`. Per-organization
  token CRUD at `/auth/orgs/{orgId}/scim/tokens`.
- Organizations multi-tenancy: `organizations`, `organization_members`,
  `sessions.active_organization_id`. Roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`.
  Single-tenant deployments leave `Config.Organizations` nil and see no
  behavior change.
- Migrations: `0006_organizations`, `0007_saml`, `0008_scim` (additive
  on `users.external_id`, `users.given_name`, `users.family_name`,
  `users.display_name`).
- Audit hook (`Config.AuditHook`): synchronous no-op stub invoked on
  every SCIM mutation and every successful SAML assertion. v1.0 replaces
  the default binding with the real async writer; the consumer-facing
  signature stays stable.
- Test fixtures: `internal/samltest` generates a fresh IdP keypair and
  signs assertions in-process for the SAML end-to-end tests. SCIM tests
  exercise the Okta / Azure AD provisioning cycle (create, patch,
  deactivate, idempotent re-create, delete).

### Added (v0.6 hardening)

- Fuzz tests for every external byte boundary: AES-GCM encrypt and decrypt
  round-trip, decrypt arbitrary input, PKCE verifier to challenge, PKCE
  verifier generation, token hash round-trip, base64 URL decode, session
  cookie parsing, OAuth state cookie parsing, email validation, OAuth
  callback query parameters, and OAuth callback provider name routing.
- Concurrency tests covering the OAuth state map, the in-memory rate
  limiter (same IP and different IP fan-out), and session creation under
  contention. All assertions hold under `go test -race`.
- Benchmark suite under `internal/bench` measuring password sign in,
  session lookup, OAuth callback storage cost, magic link consume, and
  PKCE challenge derivation. Baselines are recorded in
  `internal/bench/BASELINES.md`.
- Four new runnable example apps: `examples/gin-app`,
  `examples/echo-app`, `examples/stdlib-app`, and
  `examples/oauth-multi-provider`, each with a README, single-file
  `main.go`, `go.mod`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, and
  `Makefile`.
- Package documentation: `doc.go` added for every package, doc comments
  filled in on previously undocumented exports, runnable `Example`
  functions for the most-used entry points.
- `STABILITY.md` enumerating the stable surface and the rules that
  govern future changes.
- `golangci.yml` enables `godot` and `godox` to keep doc comments
  punctuated and to flag stray `TODO` markers.
- CI workflow now runs a per-target fuzz job (`-fuzztime=10s`) on every
  PR alongside the existing race-enabled test job.

### Post-G follow-up fixes (PRs #30, #31, #33)

After PR G landed, three small follow-ups also shipped in v2.1.0:

- **#30 chore: em-dash sweep** removed 17 surviving em or en dashes from
  comments in `middleware_ratelimit.go`, `handlers.go`, `crypto/`,
  `storage/memory/`, and the related tests. Brings the repo into full
  compliance with the project rule banning em and en dashes anywhere.
- **#31 fix(examples): go.work hygiene** added the five missing example
  modules (`chi-app`, `echo-app`, `gin-app`, `oauth-multi-provider`,
  `stdlib-app`) to `go.work` so all eight examples now build cleanly
  with default workspace settings. Incidental: three SAML-related deps
  (`beevik/etree`, `crewjam/saml`, `russellhaering/goxmldsig`) were
  promoted from indirect to direct in root `go.mod` by `go work sync`.
- **#33 fix(security): cache bust on agent suspend/revoke (N1)** closes
  a v2.1 security re-audit finding: `SuspendAgent` and `RevokeAgent`
  did not call `s.invalidate(cur.ClientID)`, so a revoked agent could
  authenticate via the `clientauthcache` Argon2-verified snapshot for
  up to the 5-minute TTL added in PR #19. The shared
  `changeAgentStatus` now invalidates whenever the new status is not
  active. Regression test:
  `TestSuspendAgentBustsClientAuthCache`.
